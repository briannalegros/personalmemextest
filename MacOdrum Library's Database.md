> OPAC increasingly also provides links to electronic texts, freeing the user from the necessity of physically locating material on the libraryâ€™s shelves

This reminds me of Carleton's Library's database: MacOdrum Library. It provides links to both electronic versions of sources via other databases on the internet and physical copies of that source that is found in the library itself. We're able to log in with our Carleton account to access the online databases and rent out the physical copy.
