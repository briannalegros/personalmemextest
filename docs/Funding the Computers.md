> In the period we're talking about, from the 1940s through to the 1960s, nobody spent more money and effort on developing computers than the US military. So as a result, nobody had more impact than the United States military on what computers looked like and what they were for, what they were good at.

By funding a majority of the development for computers, the US military influenced how and what these computers would be built for. This has impacted how we view and use computers today. They were initially complex processing machines to simplify and complete tasks more efficiently, which is what  many use computers for to this day.
