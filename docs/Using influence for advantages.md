> France and especially Britain tried to prevent or hinder the layingof these German cables. First, they tried to put pressure on Spain forcing it torefuse a German landing in Tenerife. Then they impeded an extension to Africaand South America

Good example of how the countries used their influenced over other countries to prevent their competitors from being able to set up cables in these other countries. This would give the countries a financial and tactical advantage against its competitors.
