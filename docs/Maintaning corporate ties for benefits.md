> Pender enjoyed government support in the form of naval surveys of the ocean bottoms anddiplomatic pressure on foreign governments to grant landing rights. Hemaintained close ties with the British government by placing membersof the Foreign and Colonial Offices on the boards of directors of his companies.

It's interesting to see the ways different corporations maintain their ties with other figures. Pender allowing some government control in his corporation allowed him to have access to information that other firms may have a harder time at retrieving. This gave him an advantage for setting cables and developing them for the conditions present at the bottom of the ocean.
