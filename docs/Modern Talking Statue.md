> Kircher’s talking statue was an early form of information extraction for the elites – people talking in the street would have no indication that their conversations were being funneled to those who would instrument that knowledge for their own power, entertainment and wealth.

It's interesting that now, this is similar to how people place hidden microphones or hack into other people's microphones to hear what they're saying. The idea of the talking statue has carried over to this day, but has evolved thanks to advancements in technology.
