> Months after the warended, the British government continued to demand that copies ofall telegrams be deposited with Naval Intelligence, causing manyAmericans to suspect censorship, deliberate delays, or the leakingof commercial secrets to British firms, something that the Frenchand Germans had complained about before the war.

The governments having access to the firms allowed them to have access to calls that may be between other countries' militaries. This information would allow them to have an advantage if any other wars broke out. The information could also be used to sway other countries in fear of leaking said information.
