> Great Britain played a dominant role in this network. It was incontrol of the main telegraphic market, that of the North Atlantic area. WhenGerman and French companies wanted to compete with the British ones, theytherefore had to approach their governments; they even had to turn into privatecompanies but just in name.

The British had such control over the area that other companies were forced to seek help from their governments and hide that fact if they wanted any chance at competing.
