>"Availability of open-source tools for doing so in combination with rentable computation power through cloud superpowers such as Amazon (AWS), Microsoft (Azure), or Google (Google Cloud) is giving rise to a false idea of the ‘democratization’ of AI." from [[@crawford2018AnatomyAISystem]]

>Monopolies in the world of technology, not just cloud computing. While it being 'open source' is a great thing, it also helps boost the companies reputation and allows others to do free labour for them in 'the spirit of advancements. - [Eric](https://glng3r.github.io/memex/%40crawfordAnatomyAI%20folder/Monopolies%20in%20the%20modern%20World/)

Eric isn't wrong about companies taking advantage of 'open sourcing' in order to acheive better status and free labour. While it is up to the individual if they choose to work on something from an open source, companies should at least give credit or use this opportunity to hire these individuals so that the relationship between the individual and company can become more of a sharing relationship rather than a give and take one.
