>"From a young age, we are trained to believe that the boundaries of the interface are always identical to the edge of the material platform of the page - namely, that the cognitive space and physical dimensions of the page are necessarily conterminous."

Why have we been trained to think that we can't go beyond a page. Whenever we write on them, we try not to go beyond them, but why can't we continue to expand our ideas beyond this mental space that we've constructed?
