### Summary & Key Take Aways

Wiegand summarizes many studies on the origin of the Decimal Classification created by [Melvil Dewey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvil_Dewey). It is shown via these studies that Dewey had taken much inspiration from existing library catalogues and with the help of Amherst College. His system of classification is a product of its time, heavily within an Anglo-Saxon view.
