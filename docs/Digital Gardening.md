> It's a **different way of thinking about our online behaviour around information** - one that accumulates personal knowledge over time in an explorable space.

Appleton takes this definition of digital gardening from [Caufield]([[@mikecaulfieldGardenStreamTechnopastoral2015]]). This idea is meant to describe the reflection of one's experiences on the web and understanding the relations of knowledge that has been formed throughout the journey.
