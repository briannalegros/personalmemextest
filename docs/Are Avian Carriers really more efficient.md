> In November 2009, the Australian comedy/current-affairs television program _[Hungry Beast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungry_Beast "Hungry Beast")_ repeated this experiment. The _Hungry Beast_ team took up the challenge after a fiery parliament session wherein the government of the time blasted the opposition for not supporting telecommunications investments, saying that if the opposition had their way, Australians would be doing data transfer over carrier pigeons. The _Hungry Beast_ team had read about the South African experiment and assumed that, as a developed western country, Australia would have higher speeds. The experiment had the team transfer a 700 MB file via three delivery methods to determine which was the fastest: a carrier pigeon with a microSD card, a car carrying a [USB stick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_stick "USB stick"), and a [Telstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telstra "Telstra") (Australia's largest telecom provider) ADSL line. The data was to be transferred from [Tarana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarana,_New_South_Wales "Tarana, New South Wales") in rural [New South Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales "New South Wales") to the western-[Sydney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney "Sydney") suburb of [Prospect, New South Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect,_New_South_Wales "Prospect, New South Wales"), a distance of 132 kilometres (82 mi) by road. Approximately halfway through the race, the internet connection unexpectedly dropped and the transfer had to be restarted. The pigeon won the race with a time of approximately 1 hour 5 minutes, the car came in second at 2 hours 10 minutes, while the internet transfer did not finish, having dropped out a second time and not coming back. The estimated time to upload completion at one point was as high as 9 hours, and at no point did the estimated upload time fall below 4 hours.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers#cite_note-14)

Here I thought the pigeon would be the slowest. We overestimate technology because we are so use to it that we assume that it's more efficient than other methods. In the race situation, the pigeon was able to avoid traffic and not have to worry about the internet going down, avoiding any redundancy. Of course there are the potential risks of losing the pigeon entirely and the fact that it could lose the SD card, which makes it a very risky method and why we don't use it today.
