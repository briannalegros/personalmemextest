>His talking statue was a very early listening system: essentially a microphone made from a huge spiral tube, which could convey the conversations from a public square and up through the tube, and then piped through the mouth of a statue kept within an aristocratâ€™s private chambers.... People inside the homes of aristocrats would have no idea how a magical statue was speaking and conveying all manner of information. The aim was to obscure how the system worked: an elegant statue was all they could see. Listening systems, even at this early stage, were about power, class, and secrecy.

The talking statue is a really interesting early piece of technology. Kircher's idea to further hide how it work is similar to how we box all of our modern technologies into cases, maintaining a certain magic to it.
