> Khan's point being, or the argument being that Lamey and his generation of military generals believed in personal experience. The new civilian intellectuals that were taking over the defense department at this time said that in the new world of the atomic bomb, personal experience is of no use. The only way to know anything about the new world of nuclear war is to simulate it as a game or in a computer. So that's what they did.

It's true that you can never be prepared when it comes to new technology influencing wars. Experience does give you some advantages, but there's a point we must rely on simulating and coming up with scenarios in order to prepare for every outcome.
