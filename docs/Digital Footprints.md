> the Stream presents us with a single, time ordered path with our experience (and only our experience) at the center.

The author is describing digital footprints. Each individual follows a path in which they set out to find information, leaving behind what we call digital footprints. This is our search history, comments, mentions, and everything else we leave behind on the internet. It formulates the Stream we go down to find the information we seek.
