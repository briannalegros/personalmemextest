> By the outbreak of World War II, submarine cables, like in-tercontinental radiotelegraphy, had been transformed from businessenterprises into weapons of war.

Being able to communicate with your soldiers and allies from different parts of the world allowed greater tactical advantages and larger plans to unfold over a larger area. This way you could be up to date with what was happening in different places during the war as it happened, rather than waiting months for a letter.
