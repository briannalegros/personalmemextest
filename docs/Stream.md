>In the stream metaphor you donâ€™t experience the Stream by walking around it and looking at it, or following it to its end. You jump in and let it flow past. You feel the force of it hit you as things float by.

Similar to the expression "going with the flow." The Stream represents our search history, and any sources we found along the way as we go through the rabbit hole of information of searching for a topic.
