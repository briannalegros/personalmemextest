> This realization inspired a reworking of the original end-to-end protocol, which was called NCP (network control protocol), producing in its place a matched pair of protocols called TCP (transport control protocol) and IP (internet protocol). IP would be responsible for routing packets across multiplenetworks and TCP for converting messages into streams of packets and reassembling them into messages with few errors despite the possible loss of packets in the underlying network.

This system of protocols allow the efficient communication over the network via packets. This system has become widely use across networks because of its efficiency and necessity for an efficient network. Without these protocols, packets wouldn't know which device to go to, or what path to take.
