> and haphazard printouts (from an attached printer where I would press Print Screen and dump the screen contents to a piece of paper)

I was today year's old when I learnt why the Print Screen button is called what it is. The reason why I didn't know this is because the button doesn't serve a function much anymore other than taking screenshots and saving it to the computer, where you have to go into your photo folder to print. By the way Edwards is talking about the button, it sounds like it would immediately print the screen compared to today.
