> The UK would accept to grant a landing to Germany on three conditions:first, Germany should desist from extending this cable to Morocco. Secondly,this cable should directly connect Emden and the Canaries without a halfwaylanding in Vigo. This would push the construction costs up and would reduceits capacity of work. Therefore the cable would not be as competitive and Germany could not cut prices.

No matter what, the British would continue to place hurdles in the way of their competitors as to not lose the advantage in their systems as well as the monetary aspect of their cables.
