> An OPAC is a library catalogue accessed via a computer terminal for the benefit of library users. It is a computerised catalogue of documents and reading materials available in a library. It provides online access to libraryâ€™s catalogue for users and allows the searching and retrieval of bibliographic records

I remember seeing these at the library when I use to visit. They're also included at book stores as well. They're super useful to help find the book or search up related books to a certain topic. Being able to quickly skim through a catalogue is a wonderful improvement, and saves us the time of searching for the proper area.
