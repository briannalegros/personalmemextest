My main goal for the course was to learn more about technology because I believed it has major roots in today's society. Reviewing my [[0_Final Journey_1|first Final Journey question]], I found that the evolution of technology was heavily influenced by society. I touched on how [[Technology evolving along with society|society's decisions influenced technology's advancements and how in turn this affected society]], but here I will go more in depth on how technology has influenced today's society.

As technology gets more advanced, it becomes [[Technology evolving along with society|more and more used to where in some way we are pretty much required to own certain technologies if we wish to keep up with society]]. When telephone cables were introduced, [[Cables changed the world|they impacted society as a whole just because of how useful they were]]. At some point, everyone needed to own one because if you wanted to keep up with everyone. Because of this, it was necessary that we adopted these technologies into our daily lives, [[Getting use to technology|which also requires us to get use to how these technologies work]]. Even then, everytime a new technology gets revealed and released, they too [[Timeline of Fax Machines and Mobile Devices|start to become part of our daily lives]] and then require us to learn how to use them as well. 

Because technology, we [[Getting use to technology|become more and more used to them]] because they are so useful. They've allowed us to put time into other things and [[Technology completes tasks more efficiently|still be able to create items that would normally take longer without the technology]]. We've become so dependant on technology that it has become part of our culture. When a new technology releases (new iPhone or video game for example), there are often [[Getting Excited with new Technologies|lines of people waiting to pick one up for themselves]]. Often when new devices or hardware gets released, [[Advancements of Microscopic Cameras|it is more efficient than it's predecessor]]. This leads to a wave of people who [[Out with the old, in with the new|exchange their previous one for the new advanced one with all its new features]].

With new technology, our [[Technology changing time and space|perspective of the relation between time and distance begins to shorten.]] Technology offers shortcuts that allow the distribution of items to be done faster over larger distances. For examples, [[Change in communication|telephone cables have allowed us to communicate with people across the country and overseas]] and vehicles have allowed us to transport different items across the world. This has allowed us to transport material to different factories across the world. This essentially turns the [[The Earth as a Factory|Earth into it's own factory]]. We use different materials found all over the world which allows us to create several new technologies due to [[Grey Gold|their properties and what we can turn them into]]. 

Having all of this technology has [[Working together|allowed countries to work together in creating them]]. These items and technologies created in factories from all around the world get distributed to various countries. The industry has caused the [[Telegraphy and Globalization|globalization of various customs that surround both the market in buying and selling these items as well as using them]]. [[Technology and Society|These customs get woven into our cultures and become part of our lives]]. As more and more technology gets created and introduced into our lives, the more it leaves an impact with [[Difference in efficiency between nature and digital|how efficient it is at completing various tasks]].

My [[Memex to generate new knowledge|Memex and the sources]] I have read have been able to demonstrate both [[0_Final Journey_1|the impact of technology on society and the impact of society on technology]]. It has shown me that the two work together in shaping our current society and how we live our lives. Technology has become an extremely important aspect of our lives. The impact of these two should be researched more, as how they affect each other have proven to me to be quite interesting.
