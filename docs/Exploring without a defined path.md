> The early web debates around this became known as [_The Navigation Problem_](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-55991-4_31) – the issue of how to give web users just enough guidance to freely explore the web, without forcing them into pre-defined browsing experiences. The eternal struggle to find the right balance of chaos and structure.

They wanted the internet to be a place where everyone could search and find any website, blog, etc. and be able to enjoy the vast sea of knowledge present in the cloud. I'm pretty sure hyperlinks were used to remedy this, but search browsers didn't exist yet so they had to rely on these hyperlinks to find other websites which is what they talk about when it comes to a defined path.
