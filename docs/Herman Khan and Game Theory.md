>But Khan and others like him popularized ideas like game theory, zero sum games, mutual assured destruction as they planned for and tried to imagine nuclear war. This is a famous or really an infamous table in Khan's 1960 book on thermonuclear war. 
>
>If you can see it says tragic but distinguishable post-war states. And Khan was talking about, well, what's the difference between a war that kills 20 million Americans and a war that kills 40 million Americans? And how will we, how long will it take to recover? And how can we plan to make it more likely that the World War III will kill 20 million Americans and not 40 or not 80 or not 160 million? 

Many people thought Herman Khan was a monster for thinking this way as a game. The use of the word game was used else than as a fun activity, but more as a way to describe the way he simulated and attempted to understand these scenarios. Finding the distiction between the scenarios, and finding ways to work around and improve various situations was part of the thought process that would be game theory.
