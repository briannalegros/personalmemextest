> The discovery of gutta percha, the latex of a tree that grows in Southeast Asia and forms a polymer of isoprene, a thermoplastic sub-stance that can be molded when warm, led inventors to insulate coppercables with the new mat

I believe it was mentioned in a lecture that we utilized this tree so much to the point that we made the species go extinct. We only needed the sap, so we wasted much of the tree in our creation of the cables.
