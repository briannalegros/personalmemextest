> Ports and submarine cables were the technical andindustrial features which stood out in these small backward islands supportedon an agrarian economic scheme. It is not a coincidence that the British wereresponsible for the construction and, at the same time, the main beneficiaries,since the mid-Atlantic islands played a substantial role in the imperialist projects in Africa. The Daily Mail even reported that the government of the FreeState of Congo was negotiating a deal on the archipelago with Madrid. It wassaid that King Leopold of Belgium planned to buy the islands in order to usethem as a sanatorium and coaling station.

It appears as if the British intended to bring their technology to these islands for the sole purpose on being apart of such operations by controlling the communication. This way, they too could earn money.
