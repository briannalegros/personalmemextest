> Stung by the British refusal, the German government decided tobypass British soil in three phases. The first phase involved hiring TC&M to lay a cable from Emden to Vigo (Spain), where it would connect with another British cable company, Eastern, which served theworld outside the North Atlantic (see below). This cable, laid in 1897,was a national, if not a commercial, success.

This really shows how the British controlled the market. The German companies had to go to such lengths to trick the British companies into setting up cables for them. Luckily for the Germans, this cable was well worth the effort.
