> Amy Hoy argues that [Moveable Type](https://www.movabletype.org/) didn't just launch us into the "**Chronological Sort Era**". It also killed the wild, diverse, hodge-podge personalisation of websites that characterised the early web. Instead of hand-coding your own layout and deciding exactly how to arrange the digital furniture, we began to enter the age of standardised layouts. Plug n' play templates that you drop content into became the norm. It became harder and more technically involved to edit the HTML & CSS yourself.

This dependancy on templates for websites have reduced the amount of originality and freedom that can be found in websites. It has become commonplace to use these templates and sort of organization for the website that it has also restricted the way that we can share and view information on the web.
