> The cable had deteriorated after be-ing left out in the air too long; its insulation was uneven and defectivein spots; and its chief engineer, hoping to revive it, sent too powerful anelectric current through it, damaging the insulation even further.

A lot of this can be blamed by human oversight and error. While we aren't perfect, it should've been reviewed that something of this importance should have been researched to find the best methods to preserve rather than hastily planting it in the bottom of the ocean. This project a lot of time and money, lot of it wasted by a few guys wanting to get the credit as soon as possible.
