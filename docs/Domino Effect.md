Reminds me of the domino effect. Like it, people affect people affect each other through their action. These action can spark changes in how people act, which can in turn affect another person. This eventually snowballs. In the context of inventions, each finding inspires or assists to another finding and/or idea, which ultimately sparks the creation of a machine that benefits our lives in a specific way.
