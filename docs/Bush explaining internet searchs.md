> Moreover, they will be far more versatile than present commercial machines, so that they may readily beadapted for a wide variety of operations. They will be controlled by a control card or film, they will select their own data and manipulate it in accordance with the instructions thus inserted, they will perform complex arithmetical computations at exceedingly highspeeds, and they will record results in such form as to be readily available for distribution or for later further manipulation. Such machines will have enormous appetites. One of them will take instructions and datanfrom a whole roomful of girls armed with simple keyboard punches, and will deliver sheets of computed results every few minutes. There will always be plenty of things to compute in the detailed affairs of millionsof people doing complicated things.

Here, Bush is explaining what would eventually become searching up information on the internet. At this time, the internet and comptuers still didn't exist, so this is an early version that he envisions to be a completly different machine from what we have to this day, but with the same premise.
