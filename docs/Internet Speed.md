> Thinking of _Rampage_ on the NES, which was one of my favorite games at the time, I asked my brother to download it. He declined because it would have taken over five minutes to transfer on our 2400 BPS modem. Any file around one megabyte would take about an hour to download.

Luckily it doesn't take this long to download that size of a file anymore. While it still takes a bit to download larger files, the file sizes that were long to download then only take mere seconds for us today.
