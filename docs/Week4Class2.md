Electric History

- galvanizing --> frog with metal thing in its butt and leg
- people use to mruder others to donate the body for science
- hanging isn't a quick death
- galvani's grandson still believed the energy was in the animal's body
	- he used a body of a convincted murderer and the body acted alive during an experiment
- frankenstein
	- used galvanizing to bring the monster alive
	- reflects how science was feared at the time
- rubing amber and owol together attract thing
	- greek name for amber is electron
- leyden jars
	- peter van mouchenbrook
	- tried to capture static electricity
	- barrel of gunpower hanging on a ceiling by a wire and linked it to the water with a metal ball
	- concentrated electricity (capacider)
	- tmeporarily stored electricity
- french guy
	- monks holding metal rod and stand in a circle
	- one hold a thing that has an electric charge
	- they all get shocked at the same time
- benjamin franklin
	- flies kite with key to demonstrate lightning and electricity are the same
	- cone of iron directs charge
- italian guy
	- argues that galvani's frogs charges are because of the electricity and the body's moisture
	- metals in wet piles to demonstrate charges
	- batteries
- lunatics
	- they met once a month to exchange schorlarly knowledge
- electricity and magnets
	- hans christian orsted
		- works out that electric current in a nearby wire will deflect a compass needle
		- works out that electric current produces a ciruclar magnetic field
	- michael faraday
		- works out how to go the other way, that you could use a magnet to induce electricity
	- joseph henry
		- inventor of many electrical devices, including the relay
			- one path of electricity that allows a machine to do something a distance away
		- wrap a wire around a magnet that increases the charge
		- removed distance
	- there was so much electricity in the air, that all of these things were being discovered by multiple people at the same time
- telegraphs
	- can't just string up a wire from a to b
	- think in circuits and take into account how to make it flow
	- once henry and others solved that, emssages at a distance are now feasible
	- just in time too: first steam powered railways open in the 1830s
- all the pieces are in place
	- store electricity
	- induce elecitiy to travel
	- induce changes in some device at point b by alternating electricity at point a
	- and because we know magnetic fields and electricity are connected, compass needles are really easy to move with magnetic fields generated by electricity
	- we've only scatted the surface
