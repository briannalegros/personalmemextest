I have many notes featured in my Memex. After reviewing my graph showcasing this collection of notes that I have created throughout the term, I have come to realize that the overarching theme of these notes revolve around the evolution of [[Technology and Society|technology over the years and it's relation to society]].

The earliest forms of technology that are mentioned in my Memex are about pages. Pages refers to pieces of paper. Before we had [[Not all technologies could be created until now|access to technology like computers and the internet]], people preserved their [[Preservation of Knowledge|knowledge]]and [[Stories of Knowledge|stories]] on these papers which would evolve from being stone tablets. These pages would be able [[Preservation of Knowledge|preserve the knowledge]] written on them, but also be able to preserve the social elements of society at the time of it's creation in both the writing and [[Seeing social changes within the pages|the construction of the page itself]].

Much of our knowledge before computers and the internet was written on these pages, [[Preserving important documents|it was important for society to maintain and find ways to preserve these pages]], otherwise we would lose knowledge that we had accumulated. Once we had found better ways to store this information, the knowledge on these pages would be [[Digitalization of Knowledge|digitalized]] and [[The Cloud|uploaded on to the internet]].

The internet over time due from the existing accumulated knowledge and the new information that would be uploaded to it daily turned it into [[Internet is an encyclopedia|a treasure trove of information]]. Thanks to the internet, it allowed [[Expanding the Accessibility of Knowledge|easier access to this information to everyone]], allowing society to focus on making advancements in areas that would allow [[Technology completes tasks more efficiently|completing tasks more efficiently through the creation of new technology]]. With these advancements, it has allowed society to spend less time on simple tasks and work on creating even more advancements to [[Technology improves and hinders|improve life with the improvement and creation of even more technology]].

With more improvements in technology, [[Technology changing time and space|the perspective of distance and time begins to shorten]]. The introduction of [[Cables changed the world|telephone cables]] was one of the biggest leaps since the introduction of cars and steam boats that allowed a change in the perspective of distance in a long time. These cables allowed [[Change in perspective of distance|communication over a long distance in real-time]], so there was little need to send messagers overseas. These were the first seeds that would lead to [[Telegraphy and Globalization|globalization]] now due to how easy it was to communicate between different countries, which also resulted in the [[Standardization of keeping time|standardization of keeping time]]. These advancements in communication would prove to be [[Long distance communication in the war|useful during wartime efforts]], which led to many of these companies to be funded and even controlled by their [[Company and Government ties and their advantages|country's government]].

Much of the later technology that would be created would be due to [[Events and Technology influencing each other|certain world events]], mainly by governments for war. This technology would be modelled in such a way that it would be used in order to help with war efforts, most notably [[Sage setting Standards|Sage during the Cold War]]. In [[@macdougallHowtheColdWarCreatedVideoGamesandViceVersa|Professor MacDougall's lecture "How the Cold War Created Video Games and Vise Versa,"]] it was noted that Sage was built in order to help predict the path of missles, but it was created a little too late to properly complete it's original purpose. However Sage had the appearance of what we now know today as computers, [[What Technology could have been|it was used as a basis for creating new technology which eventually led to becoming computers]].

The technology developed by the military would eventually [[Sage setting Standards|be changed and be given different uses]]. These changes would eventually be brought on to the market for anyone to buy. Much of our technology has been created due to certain [[Technology and Society|needs of society]]. [[Technology evolving along with society|These needs influence what technology is made and what it is made for]].

These technologies get shown to be useful at [[Technology improves and hinders|improving our lives]], whether it be as simple as being able to carry more items in a sturdier wagon or [[Email Boom|a computer allowing users to send each other emails]]. As a technology becomes more widely used, society needs to start [[Getting use to technology|getting use to these technologies]]. As we [[Adapting to technology|adapt more to the technology]], it becomes more and more integrated with our daily lives to where it becomes mundane. Once we've adapted to the technology, there is a need to [[Technology evolving along with society|improve upon the technology as society wishes to more jobs easier]].

Society asks for improvements in its existing technology to further benefit their daily lives, it is not always that a technology is used for its intended purpose. While most technology is developed for a certain use, [[Users make the purpose of technology|ultimately it is up to the user to give its use]]. Computers were initially [[Sage setting Standards|designed for the military to do advance processes so they could be done faster and more efficiently than humans]], however these processes led to the [[War Simulation turn Video Game|creation of video games and the internet]]. 

These uses that the users create for the technology couldn't be done without [[Our choices and Technology|the choices that it's creator made]]. What is decided for the technology and its capabilities ultimately dictate whether the technology will be able to do one thing or another, and [[Timeline of Fax Machines and Mobile Devices|this standard will follow throughout its lifetime of advancements and iterations]].

Many of our technologies, [[Sage setting Standards|most noteably Sage being the earliest form of computer]], have been [[Technological Advancements for destruction|created or modelled for the use of the military during war]]. Even existing technologies with a different original purpose like the [[Funding for Control and Access|telephone cables were funded by the military]] and used to [[Maintaining cables for advantage|improve efforts during war]]. The military would [[Money leads to Technological Advancements|pour a lot of money into making these technologies]], which ultimately impacted the way these technologies evolved.

These technologies created for war are a [[The product of social relations form an image of the importance of society|reflection of the things that society has found to be important]]. In a sense, it was important to society to create these technologies to give them an [[Communication and its war advantages|advantage during war in order to protect their society]]. The advancements made in technology reflects this, as there is a need for [[War Simulation turn Video Game|entertainment that can be found in video games]] and the need to [[Companies and Open Sourcing|simplify work through various computer programs]].

Sometimes it can be seen that there are[[Timeline of Fax Machines and Mobile Devices| many new developments made in the advancements of our technology]] that we can [[Don't estimate the effort put into the development of new technologies|underestimate the effort put into these new findings]]. A lot of [[Money leads to Technological Advancements|funding and research must go in to the creation of new technology]], it is [[Creating present technologies in the past|not something that can happen overnight]]. As we continue to develop and grow as a society, we gain access to more knowledge and resources, that [[Not all technologies could be created until now|lead to the creation even more technology]]. More advancements in technology leads to [[The Complexity of Technology|more intricate and complex machines]] that allow the completion of the task (or tasks) that it has been created to complete.

The technology we create is [[Technology comes from the Earth|limited the resources existing on Earth]]. If we are to use up all of a specific resource, then we may not be able to [[What Technology could have been|create other potential technologies that we could have with that resource]]. This happened with the [[What happened to the Gutta Percha|gutta percha]], where it was all used up to create [[Impact of cables|telephone wires]]. It is important that we preserve our natural resources and search for alternatives with our resources in order to [[Passing on Knowledge|continue expanding our knowledge to create more technologies]].

As we are restricted by our resources, we are also restricted by our knowledge. [[Not all technologies could be created until now|Many technologies that exist today could no have existed in the past because the society of the past lacked the knowledge and technology to be able to create them.]] Even today, this dilemma continues to exist. Our knowledge and technology can [[Reaching the limit of technology|only bring us to a certain point]] in the creation of even newer technology. If we want to continue creating more technology that's even better than our existing technology, it is up to [[Limited to knowledge because we have yet to discover|us to research and create the means to be able to improve our technology]].

As our society evolves, we [[Technology improves and hinders|create more and more technology that better suits our lifestyles and helps improve it]]. The creation of our technology is dictated by the needs of society, [[Technology evolving along with society|which influences the technology that is created and the path that is taken towards its advancements]]. Our lives have become so intertwined by the introduction of various new technologies throughout the ages that improve how we live our lives. In [[@macdougallHowtheColdWarCreatedVideoGamesandViceVersa|Professor MacDougall's lecture mentioned previously]], he mentions that the technology we create are tools create for knowledge by knowledge. Essentially, the technology we create technology is restricted by our knowledge, and the creation of technology is restricted by our knowledge. The two work together to improve one another, [[Technology and Society|creating more advance technology and improving society's lifestyle.]]
