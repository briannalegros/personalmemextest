I have many notes featured in my Memex. After reviewing my graph showcasing this collection of notes that I have created throughout the term, I have come to realize that the overarching theme of these notes revolve around the evolution of [technology over the years and it's relation to society]([[Technology and Society]]).

The earliest forms of technology that are mentioned in my Memex are about pages. Pages refers to pieces of paper. Before we had [access to technology like computers and the internet]([[Not all technologies could be created until now]]), people preserved their [knowledge]([[Preservation of Knowledge]]) and [stories]([[Stories of Knowledge]]) on these papers which would evolve from being stone tablets. These pages would be able [preserve the knowledge]([[Preservation of Knowledge]]) written on them, but also be able to preserve the social elements of society at the time of it's creation in both the writing and [the construction of the page itself]([[Seeing social changes within the pages]]).

Much of our knowledge before computers and the internet was written on these pages, [it was important for society to maintain and find ways to preserve these pages]([[Preserving important documents]]), otherwise we would lose knowledge that we had accumulated. Once we had found better ways to store this information, the knowledge on these pages would be [digitalized]([[Digitalization of Knowledge]]) and [uploaded on to the internet]([[The Cloud]]).

The internet over time due from the existing accumulated knowledge and the new information that would be uploaded to it daily turned it into [a treasure trove of information]([[Internet is an encyclopedia]]). Thanks to the internet, it allowed [easier access to this information to everyone]([[Expanding the Accessibility of Knowledge]]), allowing society to focus on making advancements in areas that would allow [completing tasks more efficiently through the creation of new technology]([[Technology completes tasks more efficiently]]). With these advancements, it has allowed society to spend less time on simple tasks and work on creating even more advancements to [improve life with the improvement and creation of even more technology]([[Technology improves and hinders]]).

With more improvements in technology, [the perspective of distance and time begins to shorten]([[Technology changing time and space]]). The introduction of [telephone cables]([[Cables changed the world]]) was one of the biggest leaps since the introduction of cars and steam boats that allowed a change in the perspective of distance in a long time. These cables allowed [communication over a long distance in real-time]([[Change in perspective of distance]]), so there was little need to send messagers overseas. These were the first seeds that would lead to [globalization]([[Telegraphy and Globalization]]) now due to how easy it was to communicate between different countries, which also resulted in the [standardization of keeping time]([[Standardization of keeping time]]). These advancements in communication would prove to be [useful during wartime efforts]([[Long distance communication in the war]]), which led to many of these companies to be funded and even controlled by their [country's government]([[Company and Government ties and their advantages]]).

Much of the later technology that would be created would be due to [certain world events]([[Events and Technology influencing each other]]), mainly by governments for war. This technology would be modelled in such a way that it would be used in order to help with war efforts, most notably [Sage during the Cold War]([[Sage setting Standards]]). In [Professor MacDougall's lecture "How the Cold War Created Video Games and Vise Versa,"](@macdougallHowtheColdWarCreatedVideoGamesandViceVersa) it was noted that Sage was built in order to help predict the path of missles, but it was created a little too late to properly complete it's original purpose. However Sage had the appearance of what we now know today as computers, [it was used as a basis for creating new technology which eventually led to becoming computers]([[What Technology could have been]]).

The technology developed by the military would eventually [be changed and be given different uses]([[Sage setting Standards]]). These changes would eventually be brought on to the market for anyone to buy. Much of our technology has been created due to certain [needs of society]([[Technology and Society]]). [These needs influence what technology is made and what it is made for]([[Technology evolving along with society]]).

These technologies get shown to be useful at [improving our lives]([[Technology improves and hinders]]), whether it be as simple as being able to carry more items in a sturdier wagon or [a computer allowing users to send each other emails]([[Email Boom]]). As a technology becomes more widely used, society needs to start [getting use to these technologies]([[Getting use to technology]]). As we [adapt more to the technology]([[Adapting to technology]]), it becomes more and more integrated with our daily lives to where it becomes mundane. Once we've adapted to the technology, there is a need to [improve upon the technology as society wishes to more jobs easier]([[Technology evolving along with society]]).

Society asks for improvements in its existing technology to further benefit their daily lives, it is not always that a technology is used for its intended purpose. While most technology is developed for a certain use, [ultimately it is up to the user to give its use]([[Users make the purpose of technology]]). Computers were initially [designed for the military to do advance processes so they could be done faster and more efficiently than humans]([[Sage setting Standards]]), however these processes led to the [creation of video games and the internet]([[War Simulation turn Video Game]]). 

These uses that the users create for the technology couldn't be done without [the choices that it's creator made]([[Our choices and Technology]]). What is decided for the technology and its capabilities ultimately dictate whether the technology will be able to do one thing or another, and [this standard will follow throughout its lifetime of advancements and iterations]([[Timeline of Fax Machines and Mobile Devices]]).

Many of our technologies, [most noteably Sage being the earliest form of computer]([[Sage setting Standards]]), have been [created or modelled for the use of the military during war]([[Technological Advancements for destruction]]). Even existing technologies with a different original purpose like the [telephone cables were funded by the military ]([[Funding for Control and Access]])and used to [improve efforts during war]([[Maintaining cables for advantage]]). The military would [pour a lot of money into making these technologies]([[Money leads to Technological Advancements]]), which ultimately impacted the way these technologies evolved.

These technologies created for war are a [reflection of the things that society has found to be important]([[The product of social relations form an image of the importance of society]]). In a sense, it was important to society to create these technologies to give them an [advantage during war in order to protect their society]([[Communication and its war advantages]]). The advancements made in technology reflects this, as there is a need for [entertainment that can be found in video games]([[War Simulation turn Video Game]]) and the need to [simplify work through various computer programs]([[Companies and Open Sourcing]]).

Sometimes it can be seen that there are [many new developments made in the advancements of our technology]([[Timeline of Fax Machines and Mobile Devices]]) that we can [underestimate the effort put into these new findings]([[Don't estimate the effort put into the development of new technologies]]). A lot of [funding and research must go in to the creation of new technology]([[Money leads to Technological Advancements]]), it is [not something that can happen overnight]([[Creating present technologies in the past]]). As we continue to develop and grow as a society, we gain access to more knowledge and resources, that [lead to the creation even more technology]([[Not all technologies could be created until now]]). More advancements in technology leads to [more intricate and complex machines]([[The Complexity of Technology]]) that allow the completion of the task (or tasks) that it has been created to complete.

The technology we create is [limited the resources existing on Earth]([[Technology comes from the Earth]]). If we are to use up all of a specific resource, then we may not be able to [create other potential technologies that we could have with that resource]([[What Technology could have been]]). This happened with the [gutta percha]([[What happened to the Gutta Percha]]), where it was all used up to create [telephone wires]([[Impact of cables]]). It is important that we preserve our natural resources and search for alternatives with our resources in order to [continue expanding our knowledge to create more technologies]([[Passing on Knowledge]]).

As we are restricted by our resources, we are also restricted by our knowledge. [Many technologies that exist today could no have existed in the past because the society of the past lacked the knowledge and technology to be able to create them.]([[Not all technologies could be created until now]]) Even today, this dilemma continues to exist. Our knowledge and technology can [only bring us to a certain point]([[Reaching the limit of technology]]) in the creation of even newer technology. If we want to continue creating more technology that's even better than our existing technology, it is up to [us to research and create the means to be able to improve our technology]([[Limited to knowledge because we have yet to discover]]).

As our society evolves, we [create more and more technology that better suits our lifestyles and helps improve it]([[Technology improves and hinders]]). The creation of our technology is dictated by the needs of society, [which influences the technology that is created and the path that is taken towards its advancements]([[Technology evolving along with society]]). Our lives have become so intertwined by the introduction of various new technologies throughout the ages that improve how we live our lives. In [Professor MacDougall's lecture mentioned previously]([[@macdougallHowtheColdWarCreatedVideoGamesandViceVersa]]), he mentions that the technology we create are tools create for knowledge by knowledge. Essentially, the technology we create technology is restricted by our knowledge, and the creation of technology is restricted by our knowledge. The two work together to improve one another, [creating more advance technology and improving society's lifestyle.]([[Technology and Society]])
