> Although electronic mail was not among the earlygoals of the Arpanet, by 1971 mail accounted for most ofthe traffic, and most users thought of the network as away of communicating with colleagues, a tool supporting collaboration.

Why did emails become the most used in the early days of the ARPANET? Because it was a tool that allowed communication over long distance. This allowed teams to keep up to date with their plans for projects, to know when there were meetings, or just to chat among friends. Like telephone cables, it became widely used because of its efficiency and its permanence.
