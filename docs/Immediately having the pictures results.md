These types of cameras continue to exist today, however most don't print the image directly from the camera. Advancements in technology has allowed cameras to return the results of the image immediately, and to be able to immediately have a physical version of that image in a matter of minutes as well. Pictures must be transferred to off an SD card and on to the computer to be printed, but this method is still faster, cheaper and better quality than in the past.
