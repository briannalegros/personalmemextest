> Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified. The lawyer has at his touch the associated opinions and decisions of his whole experience, and of the experience of friends and authoritiesâ€¦ The historian, with a vast chronological account of a people, parallels it with a skip trail which stops only on the salient items, and can follow at any time contemporary trails which lead him all over civilization at a particular epoch. There is a new profession of trail blazers, those who find delight in the task of establishing useful trails through the enormous mass of the common record.

A quote from Bush's 'We May Think' found in Mike Caulfield's 'The Garden and The Stream A Technopastoral.' Here Bush explains the internet, before the internet even existed. Caulfield is blown away by this, and is amazed by his explanation. It really goes to show how Bush may of influenced or inspired what the internet would become in the coming decades.
