Having a lot of notes can be a good thing, but also a bad thing. They provide all the thoughts and ideas I've had throughout the Memex, however they go far in depth and they are plentiful. I am someone who has lots of thoughts, so maybe this is an accurate representation of myself and the thoughts that I deem important to me. However in the future, I would like to work on filtering my thoughts more for notes.
