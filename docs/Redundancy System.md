> Paul Baran of the Rand Corporation undertook a series of investigations of this question, concluding that the strongest communication system would be a distributed network of computers having several properties: it would have sufficient redundancy so that the loss of subsets of links and nodes would not isolate any of the still-functioning nodes; there would be no central control; signals would traverse a series of nodes from source to destination, the exact route being determined by the set of working nodes and links at a particular time; and each node would contain routing information and could automatically reconfigure that information within a short time after the loss of a link or node.

This idea for computer networking was inspired because of the Cold War and the fear of both losing information and the possibility that the loss of certian machines that other machines relied on. This redundancy system allows the internet to continue to exist. We don't rely on one machine to host the entirety of the internet, rather its split across multiple computers, servers and machines, and can swap to another when one goes down.
