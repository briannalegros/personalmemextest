> That it took over four years for a leading technology company just to understand its own supply chain, reveals just how hard this process can be to grasp from the inside, let alone for external researchers, journalists and academics.

The more complex the technology is, the harder and more complex it is to create them. The supply chains aren't that surprising, however it really shows how much from a sociological view that society impacts the way we make and create technology.
