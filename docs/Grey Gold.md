> This soft, silvery metal is currently used to power mobile connected devices, as a crucial material used for the production of lithium-Ion batteries. It is known as ‘grey gold.’

This correlation between lithium and gold makes a lot of sense. Considering we now live in a digital age where we constantly are creating new devices, it makes sense that lithium has become as important if not more in our society compared to how gold was viewed in earlier centuries.
