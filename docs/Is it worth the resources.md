> Put simply: each small moment of convenience – be it answering a question, turning on a light, or playing a song – requires a vast planetary network, fueled by the extraction of non-renewable materials, labor, and data

The way that the author worded this appears to make it seem that automatic appliances is a waste of resources considering we can do these things without wasting any resources. Is creating convenience in our lives truly worth it?
