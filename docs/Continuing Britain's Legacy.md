> Western Union celebrated its newfound power by starting a price war with Commercial Cable, dropping its rates 30 percent. For the American companies, cables were but an extension of their domesticland networks, and they could well afford a fight. The real victim of the new arrangement was CFCT. Although it was kept on a tight leash bythe French PTT, it received no financial support in exchange, and the price war once again brought it close to bankrupt

With the Western Union taking over what the British firms left over, it appears that they are no better. They've resorted to the same tactics as the British, and have left their competitor to bankruptcy.
