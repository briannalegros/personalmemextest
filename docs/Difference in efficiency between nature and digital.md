> Known risks to the protocol include:
> 
> -   Carriers being attacked by [birds of prey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_prey "Birds of prey"). RFC2549: "Unintentional [encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming) "Encapsulation (computer programming)") in hawks has been known to occur, with decapsulation being messy and the packets mangled.
> -   Carriers being blown off course. RFC1149: "While broadcasting is not specified, [storms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_storm "Broadcast storm") can cause data loss."
> -   The absence of viable local carriers. RFC6214: "In some locations, such as New Zealand, a significant proportion of carriers are only able to execute short [hops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hop_(networking) "Hop (networking)"), and only at times when the background level of photon emission is extremely low." This describes the flightless and nocturnal nature of [kiwis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwi_(bird) "Kiwi (bird)").
> -   Loss of availability of species, such as the extinction of the [passenger pigeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_pigeon "Passenger pigeon").
> -   Disease affecting the carriers. RFC6214: "There is a known risk of infection by the so-called [H5N1 virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H5N1_virus "H5N1 virus")."
> -   The network topologies supported for [multicast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast "Multicast") communication are limited by the homing abilities of carriers. RFC6214: "... [carriers] prove to have no talent for [multihoming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multihoming "Multihoming"), and in fact enter a [routing loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_loop "Routing loop") whenever multihoming is attempted."

I'm glad that they included the risks to the system. Lot of these risks are related to nature and biology, which we're not use to in the digital age as we don't rely much on nature when it comes to waiting for data to transfer. It really shows as to the time we save and how we benefit from using digital technology instead of relying on nature in our networks.
