Honestly, pretty much all the notes I took during lectures were copy psated from the lecture slides. The lecture slides are available to the class, so there doesn't feel like there was much point in writing it down. More on this in [[Taking Notes during Lectures]].

Here's a list of the lecture notes throughout the term, curtesy of [Shawn Graham](https://shawngraham.github.io/hist1900/assets/) who made sure the lectures were entertaining and interesting.

Speaker notes can be accessed by pressing the S key for more info!
