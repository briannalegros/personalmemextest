Looking over everyone's Memexs, there's a lot of things that I wish I could change or have done when working on my Memex. I would've loved to cut down on notes and what I wrote in those notes. I would've also loved to of put my notes in folders for better organization and changed my index page to be more friendly.

Overall, I'll probably take this as a learning lesson as to what to do or not to do if I ever make something similar to the Memex again.
