One thing I'd want to do in the future is to take better notes during lectures. In [[Lecture Notes]], I mention that I merely copied what was on screen and summarized a bit of the speaker notes in my "lecture notes." In the future, and this goes for all my courses, I want to learn to take notes of what the speaker is saying in a summarized form so that my note taking can be easier and better for me to understand.
