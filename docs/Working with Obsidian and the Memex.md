Working on the Memex was fun. I love the idea of just jotting down notes on things we read and connect them together in our own little wiki. In the future, I would love to work on Obsidian more and explore more of its plugins. It's been a fun tool to use, and I would love to make personal projects and better course notes with it in the future.
