Jacquard's the Name, Weaving's the Game

- middle kingdom, ca 1897-1878 BCE. MET.
	- shows how the older looms were made and used
	- found in a tomb
	- one of the oldest technologies in the world
- Amasis Painter, ca 550-530 BCE. MET.
	- showed the steps of using a loom for textiles
	- loom weight depicted, they're found everywhere
	- social practice
	- songs that were passed down to help keep people on the beat of using the loom
- lenin/flax
	- oldest fabric
	- you can turn them into a type of thread
	- you would dye it
- silk
	- awfully expensive
	- silkworm moth
	- northern china 2700 years ish ago
	- dropped the cacoon into a tea and the silk came undone (hot water allows the thread to seperate)
	- 6000 pods --> 1 kilogram of silk
	- strong, takes colours really well, light
	- airbags, ww 2 parachutes
	- luxury item
	- silk road (asia to europe)
	- china, rome, india all connected (interlinking network)
	- drawloom (allowed them to grab the individual threads and slide other threads through them)
- Justinian 1
	- brought silk to bosantium
	- apparently this guy was revolutionary and took back places idk he spoke too fast
-  drawloom
	- owning silk garments was a symbol of pwoer and wealth
	- 2inches per day because its so taxing
	- takes 2 people to work it
	- slow - care, feeding, value?
	- how much land devoted to flax, to mulberries, to sheep, etc?
	- reproducibility?
	- training?
	- think in terms of assemblages, things coming together
- weaving terms:
	- warp - the vertical threads, held in tension
	- weft - the horizontal threads
	- shed - the space created when some warp threads are lifted up
	- shuttle - a wooden block used to pull the weft threads through the shed
	- comb - pushes the threads tight together once the shuttle has passed through
	- drawloom - enables individual warp threads to be drawn up
- Lyon
	- lar valley
	- 15th century the french king (louie the 11th)
		- establishes a silk industry in lyon
		- poached italian weavers to come
		- gave bonuses to people who could make improvements to the loom
	- connected to a river that helped the rome's empire
		- been essential for centuries
		- trade
	- individual homes, not a factory
	- 30k employed in weaving
- jacques de vaucanson 1709-1782
	- farting duck?
		- designed to be fed food, digest it and poop it
		- party trick
		- robot
	- made automotons
		- flute player
		- tamberine
	- designed an automatic loom
		- still needed 2 people
		- inspired by music boxes with the teeth wheels that made music
		- had to change the barrel around
		- allowed a repeating pattern
		- never took off
- joseph-marie jacquard 1752-1834
	- there's a silk of a painting of him
	- brackets the french reovlution
	- counter revolutionist to the revolution
	- escaped execution by becoming a revolutionary
	- his father was a weaver
		- he was living off his inherentance, but returned to lyon pennyless after the revolution
	- made looms that won innovation expos
		- gave him enough money to work on looms
	- created an automated loom (1804)
		- required many cards that allowed complicated patterns and repeating patterns
		- jacquard loom
		- 1 man job
		- cards are made with another machine which became a hole puncher
			- turned a drawning into a grid so you know where the designs went
- Napoleon
	- put huge effort into fostering technical and scholarly advancement
	- his government starts putting money into innovation expos
		- dumped into the silk industry
- Did Jacquard invent the punch card?
	- belief related to the cards for the loom
	- no - Louis Faucon/Falcon in 1728, but in his arrangment, the draw boy had to hold the card in place manually; Faucon improving an idea by his master Basile Bouchon uisng a paper tape with holes in it.
- Did Jacquard invent automatic lifting of threads
	- no - Vaucanson's metal cylinders could do that
- What did JAcquard invent?
	- An approach that applied threaded together punch cards to the automatic control of the loom.
		- 24 x speed increase! (ie 2 feet per day)
		- replicable patterns, complex patterns, multiple machines producing identical swathes of silk
	- it requires a person to connect social things together
- What really matters about jacquard's invention are the cards, not the loom
	- programmable machanical external memory
	- connected to binary?
	- early binary?
- Charles Babbage
	- dead end (what he wanted to do was beyond the technology at the time)
	- he really wanted the portrait of jacquard made of silk
	- Difference Engine / Analytical Engine
		- 'difference' because it uses the method of differences to calculate tables by adding the differences between items in a series. But had to be set up manually: no cards
	- there was no way to calculate numbers for projects and travels automatically, it was always connected
		- wanted to find a way to automate math
		- he pitched the idea and got a bunch of money to make the machine
			- never built it, only made a bit of it
				- only until 2015
		- he saw the jacquard loom
			- saw it as a way to collect and store data and to possibly do this math
			- this only was found to be important 100 years later ish
- Ada Lovelace
	- immediately sees the connection to the loom and technology
	- "We may say most aptly that the Analytical Engine weaves algebraic patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves…" - Ada Lovelace
		- depends upon cards to enter data, output data, store instructions
	- figures out how to program for babbage's idea
- S Korsakov (1797-1853)
	- worked for the st. petersberg police department
	- publishes a method for searching information stored on punched cards
	- (Worked for the Russian Police Ministry; the work didn't really penetrate the Anglosphere)
- Hermin Hollart
	- worked for the census
	- they had to go manually to each house and write the data
	- took then 7  years to calculate the data
	- his brotehr worked in the silk industry
	- he made a card for the census based off the loom cards
		- hole punching on the card over the one that apply
		- used pins to create a circuit to count with these cards
	- created a tabulation company with these machines
	- Coupling punch cards with electro-mechanical counting sets in train the development of the _digital_ computer... which we'll turn to, eventually.
	- ibm told him to sell it to business and that's when the money came in
	- listening to this story:
		- What are the _threads_ that had to come together?
		- What are the _assemblages_ that enabled these developments?
		- Who is being _left out_ of the story?
		- What other _questions_ does this story raise?
		- Identifying _keywords_ or _key-phrases_ that encapsulate those questions for you will help you surface critical readings (or indeed, primary materials)
