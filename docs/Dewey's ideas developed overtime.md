> All believe Dewey did not create a decimal classification out of whole cloth, and for the past half-century the historiography addressing its origins has tried to identify debts Dewey owed predecessors and contemporaries in classification history that he at one time or another acknowledged, overlooked, forgot, allegedly even deliberately ignored

This would imply the despite being the one who created the classification system that has been so universally used in the past couple centuries, that Dewey did not create it in one go, rather it was something that was developed over time with the help of people that he owed. It makes sense that he would leave this out, because he wouldn't want anyone to know that he owed others and that he wanted all the credit.
