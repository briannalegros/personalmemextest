> Many of these early adopters were people who understood how to build websites â€“ either professional developers or enthusiastic hobbyists. Any kind of novel experimentation with the web requires knowing a non-trivial amount of HTML, CSS, and JS. Not to mention all the surrounding infrastructure required actually to get a site live. Developers took to the idea because they already had the technical ability to jump in play around with what garden-esque websites might look like.

This freedom allows the creation of the [[Digital Gardening]], free from restrictions that have come with the [[Standardization of Websites]]. This freedom allows small notes that can be interlinked between sites and pages, creating a vast network on knowledge that welcomes the creation of new ideas similar to the Memex.
