The story of Germany struggling to set up a cable line that allowed communication and competence against other firms really shows how important networking and communication can be in a political view. We saw that the British and the French were able to restrict Germany with its pursuit due to its existing power of the cable industry in Spain. These cables allow both a tactical and economic advantage to the countries.
