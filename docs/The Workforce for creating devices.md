> The scope is overwhelming: from indentured labor in mines for extracting the minerals that form the physical basis of information technologies; to the work of strictly controlled and sometimes dangerous hardware manufacturing and assembly processes in Chinese factories; to exploited outsourced cognitive workers in developing countries labelling AI training data sets; to the informal physical workers cleaning up toxic waste dumps

It's true that much of human society could use improvements in how we treat workers. Lot of labour is put into these devices, their designs and quality reflect the social structures that they were designed within.
