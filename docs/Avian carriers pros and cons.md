Using Avian Carriers to transport information could potentially save a lot of time but there are a lot maintenance and risks to go along with the method. The pigeon could lose the information, get attacked, get sick, caught in a storm, etc. They also require a lot of maintenance. Unfortunately with this method, the cons outweigh the pros.
