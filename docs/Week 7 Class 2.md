how business shennanigans gives rise to information theory

- at the end of the 19th century, networks were not a novel idea
	- the concept wasn't novel
	- telegraph, rail, gas, water, sewer networks
	- not electrical networks just yet
- bell
	- first company founed in 1875
	- first telephone exchange operated by western union's telephone subsidery
	- first woman central office operator: 1878 emma nutt
	- idea of assigning unique numbers to subscribers suggested in 1879
	- his vision: https://shawngraham.github.io/hist1900/assets/slides/mar1#/2
		- he wanted it to become the norm isntead of just pairs
	- the addition of numbers added a form of automation
	- 'I would like to say right here... what our experience has been with young ladies' help; the service is very much superior to that of boys and men. They are steadier, do not drink beer and are always on hand'
- The Strowger automatic exchange - 1892
  ![](https://shawngraham.github.io/hist1900/assets/slides/572px-Uniselector_Stepper_detail.jpg)
	- the story goes that a Kansas city undertaker develops the exchange because corrupt telephone operators were directing traffic to his competitors
		- the wife of his competitor worked in the exchange
	- western electric buys the rights in 1916
		- just because a device is invented, doesn;t mean it has any immediate impact
		- took 20 years for it to take  action
	- early telephone 'behaviour'
		- companies not certain that public would accept doing work themselves
		- bell only starts the automatic exhcanges in 1919
- the first two decades of telephones was slowly adopting the telephone
	- wasn't immediate
	- the quality, they knew the telegraph was more efficient
	- subject to interference from other electric sources, trolleys, telegraph wires, thunderstorms
	- economics were beginnuing to change
		- hubbard initially used a rental model for pairs of phones
	- when phones were bought individually, you needed capital to maintain the exhcnages
		- more phones created more value for the user, but more cost to the provider and less profit per new subscriber
	- all the legal battles over who had precedence, who had the rights, and control and monopoly
		- hubbard goes to boston for help
- national bell becomes american bell
	- hubabrd and bell are out
	- theodore vail remains
	- the agreement with western union still in force
	- vail's stategy was to buy back control of all the little local companies that the previous bell company had licensed out
	- the idea was that this will enable bell to establish long distance telephone lines
	- vail broke his agreemnet with the western union
- 1884 american bell establishes long distance lines between ny and boston
	- creates a subsidiary company to do this: american telephone and telegraph company
	- establishes a labratory to improve long distance telephony
	- telegrpah because when it was incorporated, which had taken a legal statute
	- the NY legislature understood long distance as quivalent to telegraphy
	- first project: loading coils
		- a repeater preservers vibrations and resonance of the original signal
- 1888 all the court battles around the original patents are won by Bell
	- bell is making money hand over fist, even though rest of the economy is in depression
	- too bad the patents just won were about to expire
	- the patents expired in 1893 and 1894
		- meaning other telephone companies can set up, design their own equoment borrowing extensively from bell's designs
	- the long distance play was vail's strategy for coping with the loss of the income that went with controlling patents
	- despite all this, its commanding lead, its enormous profits, bell's system on extended as far as chicago, elaving the rest of the continent wide open
- independents appear, bell fights them with both legitimate and spurious court cases
	- they cut their rates ridiculously where their competion couldn't afford
	- refused to interconnect with other systems
	- buys up all the stocks of their competitors
- close to the next century, almost half of towns with 4000 people had
	- 2 telephone companies
	- 2 separate telephone exchanges
	- often two distinct phones in the home, to cope
	- photon new york c 1903
	- class distinction emerging: businesses and wealthy on the bell system had access to the AT&T longlines, while the rest was on the cheaper less connected systems
	- independents had many fewer subscribers, less well capitalized, comms were bad
- in europe, 1879 onwards, bell had set up subsidaries along the US model inclduing the pricing
	- municipal/provincial governments often took them over
	- resulted in cheaper rates, more rational organization
	- bell only remains in st petersburg, moscow, warsaw: highest prices in europe
- paris' system was stae owned
	- stockholm was a users' coop
	- 5 times as many phones as were in washington
- when bell's patent expired, prices did go down in the us
	- heavily regulated monopolies elesewhere charged nowhere near as much
	- breaks and accelerators are complex
- britain messed thing up:
	- court case found that telephones came under heading of telegraphy, thus subject to the post office
	- post office then gives out licenses and operates and competitor to its own licensees
	- they didn't give licenses to run beyond dec 31 1911, thus slowing down telephones until 1920s

	- invention of the vacuum tube used as repeaters permits long lines to the west cost
	- by 1916 bell had eliminated comeptiton in80% of the market
	- also owned a significant stake of western union
	- which raises the specter for bell of aniturst legislations
	- sherman act was passed in 1890, this tries to counter artificial constraints on supply and trade
		- this was all the things that bell was infact doing throughout the 1890s to cement its positon as its patent expires
- vacuum tube
	- a lightbulb through which a tungsten filament is passed
	- electric current passes through the tungsten, ehats it up, and emits light
	- to keep it from burning out, you need to have a vacuum in the bulb or a bovle gas that doens't react
	- electrons can be emitted by the cathode across the gap, where it can transmit eletricity
	- you can use this to amplify a signal
- long distance telephony was central to bell's plan to survive the expiration of its patnets
	- seemed like they were directing customers to use telegraph services that it owned or had a major stake in
	- antitrust legislation, populist politicians, interstate commerce commission: AT&T in the crosshairs
	- an attorney general gasve a warning that further consolidation would be trouble
	- all phones seemed like they were coming under the control of the govrnment
	- Vail navigated all this by agreeing that monopolies should be regulated, but government ownership would be unregulated monopoly
	- they agree to make long distance linges avaialble to smaller local companies to use, and agree to ask permission before acquiring any other companies
- WW1, AT&T gets nationalise anyways
	- meant in practice that there was an oversight board created by the government supposedly managed by the post office
	- first year of nationalization they make 40 million dollars
	- the rates went up
	- post ww1, they abandoned nationalisation
	- 1921 graham act makes the arragement of 1913 a permanent feature of us telecommunications
	- a curious feature of this arrangement was that the amount of profit AT&T could take was politically related to the amount invested in the system
		- if it was seen to be improving the infrastrusture of telephony, teh it could earn more
- this led to bell labs
	- devoted largely to pure research, as whatever invested there could prvoide cover for costs elesewhere
	- by ww2 they were worth 5 billion
	- they wanted to figure out how to pump more signals into the circuits
	- they could research whatever they wanted to, they had an inhouse jorunal for publishing results
	- ww2 turn its vast talents to supporting the war effort whle maintaining the research-what-you-want ehtos to an important degree
- claude shannon
	- a gradute student of Vannevar Bush's at MIT
		- working on analog computers to solve differential equations
		- joins bell labs during ww2 working on fire-control systems
		- during that time, comes up with information theory
	- analong computers represent continous quantities of some physical phenomena as a model of the problem to be solved
	- as an ma student, he pretty much lays the ground work for modern digital thory
		- demonstrates that boolean algebra can be represented as an electrical circuit
- Boole
	- boolean algebra has 2 variables that can be watered down to yes or no
	- he developed this as a way to ehance artistotle's logical thought and to systematize it
		- can be expressed as a kind of equation
- claude shows that electrical ciruits can perform logical operations
	- which opens the door to machines that can read instructions, perform a computation, and change their own rules based on the results of that computation
	- a digital computer
	- he does this before he joins bell labs
- he comes up with information theory at bell labs
	- emerges from his work on cryptographic systems, where he also demonstrated an unbreakable system
	- he writes a mathematical theory of communication which appears in the bell system technical journal
- redundancy is key to understanding language
	- many european languages don't rely on tonal differences, so colonizers couldn't recognize what they were hearing
	- drums pemitted a redundancy that made clear to their meanings
- bell telephone were trying to quantify dealing with the noisiness of the telephone lines
	- they found that the fewer symbols or ways of representing the message available for a message, the more of them must be transmitted to get the message across
	- for telephone engineers, symbols could be the phonemes of language or the ways electrical circuits could be completed/interrupted
- claude shannon in 1948 took this idea to its logical conclusion and developed a way to think about a message as being composed of two things
	- content and information
	- information is a measurement of the redundancy of that content, or how surpring the next letter/sound/wave is
- shannon entropy
	- a measure of uncertainty associated with a random variable
	- used to measure the average amount of information that is needed to identify the value of a random variable
	- higher entropy = greater amount of uncertainty or unpredicatability
	- it measures the amount of information that is needed to accurately predict the value of a random variable
	- a bit was introduced and is fundamental to understanding entropy
		- a bit is unit of information that has 2 possible states, 0 or 1
		- they represent the amount of uncertainty or randomness in a system
		- the more bits of information the more possible outcomes
- combining information theory (the division of a message from tis meaning) with logical circuits gives us the 20th century
	- Alan Turing's idea on what can be computable works on representing nerual networks as electrical circuits, the rendering of boolean logic into circuits as well, and much more
	- enables bell labs to make long distance telephony clearer, more reliable and mroe profitable
