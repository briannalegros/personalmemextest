> Every business exists in a political environment. Within capitalist environments, most enterprises enjoy considerable leeway. Businesses of great economic or strategic importance, however, attract government supervision, manipulation, or subsidies. Telecommunications enterprises are so vital to national security, economic prosperity, andthe dissemination of news that all governments regulate them to agreater or lesser degree.

This is very true. To do anything requires money. Funding for projects to gather material, research and information, then to take the gathered resources and combine them into instruments to enhance our knowledge. Government control becomes even more correlated when these tools can tie into enhancing military defenses, allowing advantages over other countries.
