> The French consulate in the Canaries maximized the surveillance over theactions of the German ship, in order to send a detailed report of its stay as soonas possible. Every inquiry was to be done confidentially, but Paris also contacted the Spanish State Department to warn it: the first step towards the collapse of the "balance" enjoyed among the European powers regarding to communication networks, was taking place. Thus, the French diplomacy gave freshimpetus to the efforts of achieving a Hispanic-French agreement on the Northwest part of Africa. The design of a new telegraphic status quo, beneficial forboth sides, was considered.

It was really important who was able to have control over communication. The Germans being able to contact with other places meant that the French and the British wouldn't be able to regulate their communication, which would give them a monetary and tactical disadvantage.
