> People building them make all sorts of choices. They build the computer to do one task and not to do another. They put a telephone line here and not over here. And we make these decisions and in making these decisions, ideas get embedded into the technology itself.

It's true that these choices embed themselves into technology. By deciding where parts go and how it should look, that becomes the standard of what that technology should look like. Making a new version with a completly different look can be a large gamble with people understanding and realizing what it is. These choices set up the standard of what each technology should expected look and be like.
