> Browsing search is an effective approach to searching that requires little effort and knowledgeon the part of the user.

This is super helpful, especially when we don't know the full idea of what we want to delve into. It could also be that the user wants to learn more about the subject, thus they can't go in depth of what they want to search. Overall, this is a wildly useful feature.
