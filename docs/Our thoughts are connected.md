> Gardens present information in a richly linked landscape that grows slowly over time[...] 
> The garden helps us move away from time-bound streams and into contextual knowledge spaces.

The garden helps us collect our thoughts and cultivate them. Even some rather thoughts about certain items on the web can be interlinked with other thoughts in educated settings. All of our knowledge is intertwinned with ideas and thoughts that we have.
