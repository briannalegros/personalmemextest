> Your machine is a library not a publication device.Â You have copies of documents is there that you control directly, that you can annotate, change, add links to, summarize, and this is because the memex is a tool to think with, not a tool to publish with.

The Memex is a collection of notes. We use them to encourage thinking rather than publishing them to the world. They are to generate knowledge and ideas.
