> The Garden is the web as topology. The web as space. Itâ€™s the integrative web, the iterative web, the web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another.

Cultivating information into a wiki or memex is like cultivating a garden. This metaphor connects these to ideas together. The garden of information relies on the gardener to arrange and take care of that information.
