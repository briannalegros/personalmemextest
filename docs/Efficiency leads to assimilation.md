> As faxing became a disruptive technology—“cheaper, simpler, smaller and, frequently more convenient to use,”4a virtuous circle of better technology attracted more users, which improved thevalue and economics of faxing, producing more technological innovation.

As we develop as a society, things because easier to make. We save time of attaining parts and putting them together through robots and machines in factories, allowing them to be sold at a cheaper price but still bringing profit to the manufacturers. This also in turn allows more people to own one, assimilating into our communities and becoming part of our everyday lives.
