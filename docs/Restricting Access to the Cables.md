>In order to avoid technological innovations that would render their costly investments obsolete, the cable companies restricted the entry of competitors intothe market by exclusive concessions or cartels.

It makes sense why they would want to protect their existing cables due to how much effort and money they put into them. However, restricting the innovations with these cables could leave us decades behind in technological advancements that could better the industry, rather these corporations remained greedy and decided to gatekeep the industry.
