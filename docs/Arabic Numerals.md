> Arabic numerals for classes (and within classes arranged materials alphabetically by author surname), the latter because he used Arabic numerals for first and all subsequent divisions beyond the major classes towhich he assigned number

Arabic numerals are what we use as numbers today. Using them as classes because of how highly recognizable they are similarly to the alphabet was a smart move on Dewey's part. Using universally recognizable symbols for a system of classification is incredibly important so that all members of society can understand the classification and use it effectively.
