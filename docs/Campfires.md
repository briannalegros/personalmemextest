> Tom Critchlow's 2018 article [Of Digital Streams, Campfires and Gardens](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/) was one of the main kick-off points. Tom read Caufield's essay and began speculating on alternative metaphors to frame the way we consume and produce information. They suggested we add _campfires_ to the idea of streams and gardens – the private Slack groups, casual blog rings, and [Cozy Web](https://maggieappleton.com/cozy-web) areas where people write in response to one another. While gardens present the ideas of an individual, campfires are conversational spaces to exchange ideas that aren't yet fully formed.

It's true that the idea could use a representation of the collective that may work together to formulate more ideas. Working together with others to expand on ideas gives us new insight into subjects that may generate new knowledge that can be added to the Garden.
