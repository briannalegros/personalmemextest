> Inspired by Licklider and Roberts, Donald Davies of the National Physical Laboratory in England proposed in 1965 a computer network using telephone trunk lines ranging in speed from 100 kilobits per second to 1.5 megabits per second, messages broken into "packets" of 128 bytes each, switching computers that could process 10,000 packets per second, and special interface computers that would connect mainframe "hosts" to the packet network without requiring alterations in the hosts' operating systems. From his own experiments in 1966 with direct-dialedtelephone links between computers, Roberts concluded that the packet-switching architecture ofthe proposals of Baran and Davies would be required to overcome slow and unreliable telephone circuits and would, moreover, be cheaper.

Allowing the communication between devices over a network to be broken up into packets makes it easier that the communication won't be interrupted during power outages or if a server goes down. It is also cheaper as these packets can travel in any path making it faster to reach the receiving end.
