> From philosophy (the science containing all sciences), Harris saw a natural structure of knowledge progressing to theology (the science of the absolute), government, philology, nature (including mathematics, physics, chemistry, and the natural sciences), theuseful and the fine arts, and finally, geography, biography, and history.

Harris choosing to classify the knowledge by study of science is quite interesting. At the time, most books that were categorized were books for research and knowledge, so it makes sense to sort them by the sciences so that researchers can easily find the subject they're studying under and go from there.
