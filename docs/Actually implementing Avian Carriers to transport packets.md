> On 28 April 2001, IPoAC was implemented by the [Bergen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergen "Bergen") Linux user group, under the name CPIP (for Carrier Pigeon Internet Protocol).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers#cite_note-4) They sent nine [packets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_(information_technology) "Packet (information technology)") over a distance of approximately 5 km (3 mi), each carried by an individual pigeon and containing one ping ([ICMP echo request](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICMP_Echo_Request "ICMP Echo Request")), and received four responses.

I'm surprised that they actually implemented the april fools joke. It's obvious why we don't use this method due to the success rate and the time it takes for the packets to get from point A to point B.
