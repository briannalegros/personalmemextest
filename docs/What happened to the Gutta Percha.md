> A mature palaquium gutta could yield around 300 grams of latex. But in 1857, the first transatlantic cable was around 3000 km long and weighed 2000 tons â€“ requiring around 250 tons of gutta percha. To produce just one ton of this material required around 900,000 tree trunks. The jungles of Malaysia and Singapore were stripped, and by the early 1880s the palaquium gutta had vanished. In a last-ditch effort to save their supply chain, the British passed a ban in 1883 to halt harvesting the latex, but the tree was already extinct

As we create greater technologies, we end up taking more and more resources. The gutta percha is a good example of what we need to watch for in the future, preventing any more loss of species. If we preserved the tree, who know what else we could've have been able to use with the latex it was able to produce.
