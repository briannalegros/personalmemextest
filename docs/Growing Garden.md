> Gardens are never finished, they'reÂ **constantly growing, evolving, and changing** [...] Gardens are designed to evolve alongside your thoughts. When you first have an idea, it's fuzzy and unrefined. You might notice a pattern in your corner of the world, but need to collect evidence, consider counter-arguments, spot similar trends, and research who else has thunk such thoughts before you. In short, you need to do your homework and critically think about it over time.

As we add notes to our Memex, the ideas surrounding these notes tend to evolve and change form as our knowledge on the subject expands. Our notes reflect this, and as a result our Memex grows.
