> Thirty years ago last week—on November 25, 1992—my BBS [came online](https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/914/retro-scan-of-the-week-the-cave-bbs-turns-20) for the first time. I was only 11 years old, working from my dad's Tandy 1800HD laptop and a 2400 baud modem.

It's crazy to think that only 30 years ago people were able to easily get access to computers to make programs and games. The world of computers was still young, there was less expectation in quality due to the existing possibilities with this technology that would later increase in time.
