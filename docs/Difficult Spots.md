> Allendesalazar clearly saw that they were stuck in a very difficult situation and that it would be quite hard for his government to please everyone.Contrary to what may be thought, he wrote to his ambassador in Berlin that itwould be the Spanish interests - not the outside pressure - which would decide.

It sucks that countries in power were able to put such countries in a difficult spot. The Spanish were in a situation where both German and British and French support would benefit them, so instead of angering one side (which could easily have negative outcomes for Spain), they wanted to find a situation where everyone could be happy with the outcome.
