> So here's Ellsberg in 1959 playing war games, playing simulations of war. And actually this picture is where this story started for me. Seeing this picture is where I got sort of interested in this story because if you are a nerd of a certain age like myself, this looks very familiar. These kinds of hex maps and dice and this sort of thing. This is the, in addition to being part of the Cold War story, this is the prehistory of war games and role playing games like Dungeons and Dragons and World of Warcraft.

I find it really interesting that these games originated from game simulations from war time efforts. It does make sense that these ideas would leak out to game developers and they would use these ideas and implement them into a tabletop or video game. The ideas for the simulations inspired and created the foundation for a lot of roleplaying games to this day.
