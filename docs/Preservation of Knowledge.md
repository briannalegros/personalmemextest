> "Moreover, Eisenstein argued that the standardization of texts that was engendered by printing technology in turn gave rise to a new social order. This order, a specialized group of writers, readers, and artisans, came to understand books in a fundamentally different way from their predecessors, whose intellectual activities, it was believed, had been encumbered by the inconsistencies and deficiencies of manuscripts."

Here the author is explaining that thanks to printing, information was able to be less warped and preserved over time. This resulted in the proper knowledge being transmitted between groups of scholars, which allowed us as humans to become smarter, because now we had the proper information compared to the inconsistencies of prior texts.
