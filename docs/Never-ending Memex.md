> They're not following the conventions of the "_personal blog_," as we've come to know it. Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites act more like free form, work-in-progress wikis.

This idea that Appleton is talking about is awfully similar to what our personal Memexs? are. There is no order to read the notes, rather you can go to whatever note and follow the interlinkage from there. It's like a wiki, but every note is everlasting and never concluded.
