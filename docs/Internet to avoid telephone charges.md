> Not long after my dad brought home the modem, he handed off a photocopied list that included hundreds of BBS numbers from our 919 area code in North Carolina. Back then, the phone company charged significantly for long-distance calls (which could also sneakily include parts of your area code), so we'd be sticking to BBSes in our region. This made BBSes a mostly local phenomenon around the US.

It's interesting that the internet was used to work around the high costs and shady practices of the telephone companies. As telephones became more widely used becoming a necessity in society, companies were more prone to taking advantage by charging higher costs.
