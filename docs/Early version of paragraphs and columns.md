>"The pagina thus emerges in the scroll as a conceptual structure by which information could be organized; it visually divides the long roll of writing material into shorter sections for the effective transmission of ideas."

Could this be referring to the paragraphs and columns that we use to separate ideas in our texts today? Or is this an early version of this?
