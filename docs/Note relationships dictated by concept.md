> Gardens are organised aroundÂ **contextual relationships and associative links**; the concepts and themes within each note determine how it's connected to others.

This is really true. While working on the Memex, I use tags to indicate the larger concept and themes surrounding the notes, meanwhile the source notes boil down to the specific concepts within the notes. These concepts dictate what note is connected to which, but there will always be an extra note from our source that will be able to connect outwards to another concept from another source, allowing all the notes to be intertwined.
