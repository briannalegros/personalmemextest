> The point is that in 1947, even people who knew more about computers than anyone else in the world had little idea about how the technology was going to develop, about what the computer was going to become, and about really what it was for.

We can never be certain what a technology may be used for or what it will become. It takes the people using them to develop the needs and purpose of that technology, rather than desgining it for a specific purpose, because no matter what it's the people who use it who create the purpose.
