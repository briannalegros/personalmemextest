> But again, the history of computers and the history of the Cold War are so inextricably intertwined that if you're talking about one, you are in fact talking about the other. We wouldn't have had the modern computer without Cold War research. And we wouldn't have had the Cold War, at least not in the shape that it took, without the computer.
> 
> It's not just that Cold War military research developed the computer, although it did. It's not just that computers were used by the military, although of course they were. But more than that, Cold War politics and a certain Cold War mentality, a Cold War way of looking at the world, was embedded in the machines, was built into the computers themselves. And our ideas about computers, but also in the actual technical architecture of the machines. And then the machines in turn, the computers made possible the politics and the strategy of the Cold War.

It would make sense that a major world event would have an impact on the development of technology as they were molded to fit the needs for the war, but it's also interesting that the technology developed changed and influenced how the Cold War played out. The war steered the direction in which the development of computers went which in turn steered the war itself. Their histories therefore end up being intertwined by this relation, which makes each other a product of the other.
