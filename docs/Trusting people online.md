> At 26, he was far more wizened and mature than most sysops I knew. He felt like a full-fledged adult. We even began speaking "voice" (as we called it) on the phone occasionally so he could help me out as I entered various settings, and I remember my mom giving him a verbal screening to make sure he meant well. He really did, and looking back, I consider him a valuable mentor.

With the internet being new, it makes sense parents wanted to make sure that the people that their kids were talking to were safe for them. There are many bad people who exist, and unfortunately some use the internet to take advantage of others. In our current day, I don't see many parents keeping an eye on their kids when they're online, which leads to them causing trouble for themselves or others. Why are parents more trusting of the internet than before, when there are more people online compared to the past?
