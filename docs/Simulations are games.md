> An MIT graduate student named Jay Forrester wanted to build a smarter simulator. He wanted to build a general simulator or universal simulator by which he meant one that he could program to simulate any set of flying conditions. A kind of video game.
> 
> Between 1944 and 1949, Forrester's project got more and more elaborate and he got interested as it got more complicated, he got interested in digital computers and he speculated he said maybe someday computers would be fast enough that we could simulate aerial warfare in something approximating real-time.

A lot of the time I feel that we forget that video games are simulations. FPS games simulate gun warfare, and a lot of games with aerial mechanics simulates flying. Even fantansy games they're simulating fantansy scenarios.  Simulation is one of the foundations for video games, what inspired the creation of more games that simulated other types of scenarios which then expanded further into games.
