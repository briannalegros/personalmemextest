> British cables extended around Africa and Asia and hadmore than enough capacity to handle whatever traffic other nations'traders, shippers, and colonial officials could generate. Hence, Britainhad the field to itself in the crucial formative years.

Seeing how the British were able to get their cables up and running so quickly reminds me of how they colonized so many colonies quickly. It's possible they treated it as such: a race to set up the lines as quickly and effectively as possible to control the industry.
