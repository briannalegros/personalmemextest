> Somehow, my long-distance friend and his crew knew about what we were doing. He called in impersonating Radon one night, uploaded an EXE file, and said something like, "Here are the new menus you wanted." I trusted him and ran the file.

> It was New Year's Eve 1992, and I sat and watched as a Trojan called "Schizophrenia" wiped my hard drive, destroying everything I had built.

It's unfortunate that people were able to impersonate others to mess with other people and destroy so much by tricking them into downloading files. Internet safety wasn't much of a thing back then, so it makes sense why Edwards wouldn't think twice about downloading the file from whom he thought was Radon.
