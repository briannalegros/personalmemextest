Digital, Electronic Computers: Competence and Social Necessities

Competence
- _machine ratiocinatrix_ versus _nulla nunc celebrior clamorosiorque secta quam Cartesinorum_
- a computer that thinks versus the mind and body
	- if it can think it must have a mind

Alan Turing
- [On Computable Numbers, with an application to the _Entscheidungsproblem_](https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/hgdufh/alma9951907063505162)
- the idea that we can put math together in a system that we can prove
	- if we have all the blocks to math we cna understanding everything
- The Turing machine
	- show a series of steps to help with solving a problem
	- describes a human computer
	- making a coorelation between a state of the human computer and a certain task that a machine can perform
	- any problem cna be "solved" as long as they're symbolic with this machine
	- this mahcine is an idea
		- others were going down this path too
	- the machine predicts the outcomes depending on the condition
	- tying the machine's state to the human's state of mind meant that this thinking machine was possible
	- this machine depended on Boolean algebra
	- it manipulates symbols

Shannon and telephone exchanges/relays
- put focus on the accuracy of the info being transmitted
- if its quantifiable, it can be exoressed as a probabiltity/uncertainty
- using bits to condense information

Combining information theory with Turing's universal computer
- we get a way for a machine to simulate any work the human computer could do

John von Neumann
- mathematician who contributed across multiple fields
- heavily involved with the Manhattan Project, early digital computations and a professor with the Instute for advanced study in princeton
- in a report in 1945, he makes a connection between the use of the telephone relay technology with the way neurons work in animal brains
	- can be in discrete state
	- explicitly makes the connection between switches/bits/information and cognition
- long tradition in western thought where we think of the human through the metaphor of whatever technology is dominant
	- mechanemorphism
	- works the other way too

Babbage
- turing framed his language of universal machine to pay hommage to babbage
- the machine was to use punch card
- one set had the instructions, other had the data to work on
- inputting the data kept it in store
- computing done in the mill
	- jumps between the mill and support
	- prints out the results

Georg Scheutz
- builds babbage's difference engine in 1844
- used in labs and some government offices
- second half of the 19th century lead to the emergence of corporations and other devices starting to change things

Kelvin
- parallel kinds of computing deices, the analogue simulators
- kelvin's tide calculator for different points around the world
- kelvin proposes in 1876 a way of linking several similar devices together physically to simuate differential equations
- the mechanisms to achieve this not developed until 1920s, and bush
- other groups replicate bush's work
	- 8 of these analogue computers around the world in the 1930s
	- includes the us where they used to calculate ballistic trajectors under different conditions

PRogramming the machines
- literally bashing them into different shapes with hammers and wrenches
- useful for scientific analysis
- IBM counters and tabulators meeting business needs
	- it could add, substract, multiply
	- other machines/prototypes could retrieve and photocopy data held on a 35mm film
- business had sophisticated machines, academics had sophisticated machines, no real burning market need for a machine that could alter its own program
- Edwin Black's IBM and the Holocaust
	- germany being its 2nd bigest market
	- happy to sell it to them despite the calls for boycots
	- pumping money into tis german subsideray to help with 1933 german census
		- the nazis use this to start ethnic identity programs

George Stibitz (Bell LAbs) 1937
- Leondardo Torres y Quevedo 1915
	- suggests using telephones switches to control the operation of his mechanical calculator
- Stibitz 1937
	- uses telephone relays over a weekend to wire a simple logic circuit to perform binary addition
	- wins him some funding to build the first complex calculator (Model 1 finished by 1940)
- demo where he performs a remote calculation over a telephone line
- over the war he builds electromechanical calculators
	- eahc more sophisticated, but still tuned for one task
	- model 2 tested anti aircraft detectors
	- model 3 anit aircraft ballistics
- 1950 this line of research is eclipsed by all electrical machines

Konrad Zuse 1936
- building electromachanical binary calculators from telephone parts
- achieves no business success with these
- joins wehrmacht in 1939
	- aerodynamics research institute
	- spots his calculator work
	- relieves him of his active duty and sends him back to his engineering job to build the S1 (calculator to speed missile production)
	- 1943 he starts his own firm with support from air ministry
		- develops the z3
		- programmable but uses 35 mm film with holes in it
		- can store 64 binary digits
		- flees berling in 1945 with his z4
		- caputred near the austrian border

Howard Aitken
- prof at harvard
- designed his own electromechanical calculator to help with his thesis work
- proposes the machine to the military in 1937
	- they said no but after reviewing what the egineer wanted it, they introduced aitken to ibm and thomas watson
- watson saw aitken as a way to sell the navy tabulating machines
- 1939 navy and ibm funded aitken to build electromagentic machine at harvard
	- his staff come from the navy too, including grace hopper
- first machine mar 1 given to ahrvard as a gift
	- he wanted a honorary degree but they ignored him
- aitken sees watson as a nuisance
	- watson saw it as public relations

Existing 'social necessity' good enough for electrico-mechanical calculators, not enough for all-purpose general computers
- they worked
	- they did calculations, could be tuned towards different tasks, but didn't operate on symbols or change their programming in reaction to their own calculations
- WW2 and the cold war provided the impetus
	- pulled all the strands from the term together

Ballistics
- industrialization of war over the 19th century lead to the new types of guns and firepower
- Reverend FRancis Bashfort
	- experiements related to air drag and velocity 1864-1880
	- produces the first firing tables
- us military after the civil war establishes testing ranges to train ballistic officers and work out tables for different kinds of guns
- you need to know waht angle, how much  powder, temperature, humidity, etc. to drop the shell on the enemy
- tables calculated by hand
	- typically women
	- naval observatory 'harem' guy late 19th/early 20th
	- more guns lead to more conditions of use emerging during the war than the computer could keep up with
- had to tabulate dozens of factors for 1000s of possible trajectories, each one half day's work
- kilogirls, cheeky unit of emasurement of 1000 hours of work by a woman computer
- 15 tables being produced a week but needed 40

Mauchly and ENIAC
- electronic numerical integrator and calculator/computer
- prof at urinus college
	- interested in meteorology
	- despairing at the calculations too a summer course at moore school of electrical enegineering in 1941
		- learn about electronic device 
		- he had a paper by john atansoff describing the deisgn of an electronic calculator he was building
		- instead of relats he would use vacuum tube valves
		- in summer 1941, mauchly visits atansoff and learn more about it
- mauchly writes a memo 'the use of high speed vacuum tube devices for calculating'
	- memo gets lost but herman goldstine naval attache officer working at the moore school
	- overseeing ballist firing table generation on an analogu differential analyzer mentions it to the operator as pergaps a better way of doing it
	- secretary reconstructs it and theyw ant to use the idea
- 3 years to build
	- took 20 seconds to calculate
	- first programmable, electronic, general purpose computer

Women
- the computers were girls
- they broke the problems up and did the math
- the girls figured out how to put the problem on it
- they had to understand both pure math and engineering
- 1881 pickering didn't like work ethic of his hired help, his hired his housemaid as a computer-wilhelmina fleming
	- fleming eventually supervises 80 other women of 36 years working
- these women were skilled and talented mathmaticians and astronomrerss

Lovelace
- she couldn't publish her own thoguhts so she did so through annotations while translating the work of the italian scholar Menebrae
- wrote so much that it was 3 time the length of the article
- describes how to set babbage's engine in train
	- in order to calculate things like bernoulli numbers
	- conceptualizes how other kinds of things might get compted
- thinking in terms of symbolic logic
- she died of uterine cancer at 36
- her work fades away
- she had to understand its engineering completely
- babbage had to figure out how to add, substract, etc. lovelace had the harder job

Grace Hopper
- mathematics prof at vassar
- joins war effort in navy
- she ends up working for aitken
	- he hands her a complex set of equations
- she studies wiring diagrams, card reader manuals, whatever existed
- mark 1 is a paper tape machine, so every algorith is linear, no loops
- she writes the manua; for the machine and its successors (500 pages)
	- doesn't get her name on it

use of bug to indicate something gone wrong in machinery had been used for decades, does not origiante in computing, but this was perhaps the first literal case of a programming bug

ENIAC SIX
- betty holberton, jean jennings abrtik, kay mcnulty, marlyn wescoff meitzer, ruth lichterman and frances bilas spence
- had to track each piece of data, wire it into a panel, such as a multiplier or a ‘square rooter,’ and then move the result — physically by wire — to another panel for storage,” she said
- had to keep track of steps and diagrams for the wires manually
	- pedaling sheets
- could handle branching logic and loops
- write the first algorithms that could write their own algorithms
- come up with idea of subroutines and packaging little pieces of code together for reuse
- assigning symbolic letters/numbers to these to speed up programming work
- MCC company with women in positions of authority
	- not a good business though
	- bought by rand in 1950
	- women had to work in a hierarchy and report to men who didn't know what was happening
	- salesmen couldn't figure out how to sell themachines
		- the women sold 40 in a year when they expected 6
