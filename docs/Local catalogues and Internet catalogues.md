> According to ODLIS, ‘an Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC) uses a graphical user interface (GuI) accessible via the world wide web, as opposed to a text-based interface accessible via telnet’. Thus, Web-OPACs are those OPACs which make the searching of resources of a library possible through the world wide web

This comparison reminds me of MacOdrum vs. Ottawa Public Library. MacOdrum's library has access to sources beyond its database located in other databases, opposed to Ottawa Public Library that only provides items within its catalogue.
GUIs are more useful than simply text based interfaces, as providing images of the sources makes it easier to identify and navigate.
