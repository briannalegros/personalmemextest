### Summary & Key Take Aways

Edwards recounts his experiences back in the 1990s when BBSes were popular. He ran a BBS when he was 11 years old and recount the various memories he had when running it. Once BBSing died out, he [archived it](https://archive.org/details/1999-cave-bbs-file-section)and began a new one on the intranet that has been running for over 17 years now.
