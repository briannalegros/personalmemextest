a network we need more than just 2 computers talking together
- the telegraph is more like the internet because more people we communicating together
- Oct. 29th 1969 isn't really the birth of the internet

problem around focusing on american history
- it makes a "Whig" history
- narrative of progress
- ends with NA liberal political stuff

one netowrk doesn't make an internetwork
- needs more than just a computer
- legault
- france now wants bombs too
- french agenda begins at the end of the war
- american competitors buy computer companies in france
- not sharing info with the french
- new economic goals
- plan capool
- make a research agency to work on computer
- new company for computers
- they see the work of IMP and in britain
	- switch focus

Cyclades
- 1971, demo'd in 1973, fully operational 1976
- name refers to a group of islands to refer to how the networks will connect them within the vast sea of knowledge
- project led by Louis Pouzin
	- showed that any IBM part can be replaced by off the shelf brands
- coined the term of "datagram"
	- data + telegram
	- gets the hosts to do the error correction, not the routers
	- makes the hosts responsible for delivery of the data on a best effort means
		- timeouts
	- the routers ensure transparency end to end
	- this greatly simplifies interconnectivity
	- the routers ensure that what gets sent is the only thing
	- thinking beyond itself
		- how do we encorporate it with other networks
- designed from the outset to connect different networks together (unlike ARPANET)
- 13 million franks for a sea wire for data only
- found on geopolitical grounds

In the pacific
- engineers don't care about the political stuff, they keep talking
- Alohanet
	- uni of hawaii
		- near honolulu on the main island and oahu, kauai, maui and hawaii (radius of 300km)
	- 1968 department of electrical egineering begin planning a way to broadcast data over radio instead of wire
		- wires would be costly
	- to permit sharing of the main campus computer
	- technical issues solved and goes into use June 1971
		- figuring out how to manage multiple signals without losing any
		- frequencies interrupting each other
		- found a solution by if the terminals waiting a random amount of time before broadcasting it won't itnerfere
			- receiver would send a signal that they got it

In space
- Satnet
	- proposed by LArry Roberts in 1970
		- to connect ARpanet to Davis' national physical laboratory netowrk
		- eventually comes to fruition by 1973, but to the university college london instead
	- cold war paranoia turns into useful technology

PRNET
- packet radio network
- inspired by alohanet
	- put it ina truck
- develops a readio receiver/broadcater that can use packets (mobile router)
- great interest to the military

In Europe
- european informatics netowrk
- share resources
- promote comptuer science
- test bed for techniques
- proposed in 1971, work begins in 1973, 10 countries wired up by 1976

Some were commercial
- Telenet
	- sell them access to computer power
	- spun out by BBM
	- the post office by the stuff from telenet
- some aren't official
	- Pam Hardt
		- cs student when the US was bombing a 3rd party
		- drops out to protest
		- comes across resource 1
			- warehouse that hippies took over and are running
			- every was living in little pods
			- switchboard that ran via humans
				- people would call others for you
		- she joins resource 1
		- decides the need a big computer
		- she finds a company that's been leasing comptuer to colleges/universities
		- she convinces them that it would help with taxes and takes it
		- she ends up with a machine from SRI
		- they figure out how to program it
			- programs that help them deal with social data
			- community memory 
			- people leave notes for stuff
			- the figured out what it meant to be online before it was a thing
			- first social network
			- stuff from the switchboard  stored
			- started printing stuff out from the database
			- brought it to social worker offices
		- pam hardt rolling stone resource 1

Who keeps the directory
- ignored at first
- woman work
- keeping track of stuff is what has given google power
- they gave it to the people that they deemed lesser

Elizabeth JAke Feinler
- studied as a chemist
- organized information for them
- got bored, decided she liked dealing with information instead
- decided to work at the SRI
- ARPANET decides to hire her
- gets told to make a resource handbook, but they don't know what it is
- she ends up making it
	- both physical and digital database
	- resources at every host
	- responsible technical administrators
	- 1000 pages, record of every node, insitution and person who together made 'ARPANET'
	- goes on to create a directory, ever person on the arpanet and how to find them
	- registers all new hosts, all new documentation, all new how-tos
	- if you wanted to know who was on the internet, this is what you used
	- her team worked on the host table
	- how we have inter addresses
	- made the fundamentals of a DNS
- she eventually builds the WHOIS command and database into the system
	- to find who owns a website
- the history the internet isn't just about the tech, it's about the people

NIC
- the work of women is seen as a threat in some corners
- they find out how important jake's office is
- ARPANET is left as a research and play thing with some military nodes in it
- 1969 - 1973
	- a period of ferment
	- other netowrks start up
	- other ways of implementing similar ideas
	- in a context of national competition and paranoia
	- including non-government operation
	- ways of being mediated through these netowrks
	- ways of being augmented by computers and networks
- ARPANET project oversight
	- Bolt, Beranek and Newman
		- IMP hardware, software and operations
	- UCLA naalysis
		- how well is it working
	- netowrk analysis corporation
		- topology
		- how well is it connected
	- SRI
		- netowrk information center
	- network working group
		- hosts protocols
- 1970s wasn't really working beyond the technical sense
	- first international conference on computer communications in washington 1972
		- lots of things being demo'd
			- air traffic simulation
			- real time conferencing
			- computerized chess player
			- joseph weizen baum's ELIZA program
		- they set up a terminal/host system at the conference demonstrating ARPANET
	- users:
		- consulant: 'the network user, new and established, is probably the most neglected element within the the present development atmosphere'
		- being neglected
	- unintended users
		- michael hart at U of illinois
			- posts declaration of independence on his site's computer in 1972
				- start of project gutenberg
		- users at MIT found they could use the IMP to speed up local data communications on their own campus
			- not even sending material onto ARPANET
				- local area network
		- games
			- was made to connect with his kids
			- it blew up in popularity
			- someone added magic elements to it, Zork
			- first commercial game
		- these users helped build internet culture
	- every was protective of their information
	- emails saved it
		- sharing files
		- got people excited to share with others
		- people were more interested in playing

ARPANET is not the Internet
- Vint CErf and Robert Kahn
	- got credit for the building blocks that makes the internet
	- there's always other people behind it
- Xerox Palo ALto REsearch CEnter
	- adapts alohanet method for wired communicationa round its facilities
	- ethernet cable
		- part of the solution
		- high speed cables for computer to computer communication
	- internet was for secure communication during wars
		- idea of adapting all the networks for wartime
- cerf and kahn oversee a series of meetings and seminar to hammer out details amongst interested parties
	- datagrams from cyclades
	- error correction and random access from ethernet/alohanet
	- no more imps or network control protocol
		- the host itself has to handle this
	- transmission control protocol (TCP) hammered out by 1973
- the boundaries between networks, the creation of gateways
	- companies emerge to physically handle the gateways
	- we want the distance to be as short as possible for faster connection
	- special computer to handle packets from sent between networks

1978: TCP splits into TCP/IP
- split into 2 protocols
- TCP as a blueprint for computers talking together
- IPs for how the data gets shared between them
	- firewalls itnerrupt this
- both make the least amount of assumptions
- more protocols out there
	- x.25 one of the prominent ones in canada at the time
- real birth of the internet nov. 27 1977
	- computer on teh highway that sends a message
	- PRNET to ARPANET gateway
	- then  travels through ARPANET to the east coast
	- then satelite uplink through SATNET gateway
	- then travels through SATNET to europe
	- then travels back to a computer in Santa Barbara via ARPANE
- BBN starts packaging TCP/IP into unix operationg systems
	- gets incorporated into other machinery too, inclduing IBM machines
	- most hosts on ARPANET continued to putter along with the original specification
		- they were happy talking amongst themselves
	- decision from high:
		- shift to the TCP/IP by january 1983 or be cut out of ARPANET entirely
	- DCA was worried about the growth making it easy to hack into the network
		- decided to split military arpanodes out of it into a MILNET
		- means figuring out exactly which computers/hosts/IMPs, phone lines are military, which are not and so on

Summary
-   before you can internet, you need to network
-   users have to find a reason to use
-   your users aren't who you might think they are
-   what they'll use it for isn't what you think it'll be
-   simpler wins out over complex
-   military & politics are always in the background
-   the internet is 'invented' 1973-1983
-   Internet Culture is happening at the same time, and not even mostly on ARPANET
