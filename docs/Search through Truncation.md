> Majority of OPACs permit the user to broaden the search through truncation method. This is a strategy to search information by entering the root part of a word with multiple variants or spellings using a symbol (usually*) but the symbol varies in some softwares. The search word can be truncated from both right and left hand side. For example, librar* would retrieve library, libraries, librarian, librarians, etc. This search method is generally used when character-by-character exact match does not help

This is super helpful in the way that allows users to be able to view sources with any version of the word. This allows us to avoid missing out on any sources, especially the ones that may be crucial to our investigation.
