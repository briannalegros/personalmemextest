> "The markings on the page are a part of the 'cultural residue' left by a battery of authors, scribes, artists, booksellers, book owners, and readers, and can be read as a compelling narrative about the social history of thought."

These markings come in different forms. Whether it be pencil markings or coffee spills, these markings leave behind a story and an idea of the era it originated from. These markings can reveal hints of society from at the time that we may not of known of originally.
