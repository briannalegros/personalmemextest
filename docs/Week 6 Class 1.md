- we've seen how lots of techs exists as assemblages
- assemblages can be thought of a complex systems
- in the right conditions, complex systems can evolve
- what's the right conditions? why was it the electrical telegraph?
	- what did it teach us about networks powered by electricity
	- we need a framework that helps identify the why of the story
	- hisstory is a verb, an inquiry; we inquire to udnerstand why

	- there's a reason as to why people come up with the same ideas at the same time
		- they pull from the same scientific grounds
- ![](https://shawngraham.github.io/hist1900/assets/slides/model4.png)
	- tech is more than the scientific base and the idea of the creation
		- there must be a more social "raison d'etre"... a role for it to fill
- ![](https://shawngraham.github.io/hist1900/assets/slides/model5.png)
	- many telegraphs were made by various people, but what makes the telegraph THE telegraph
		- what wins is ebcause of the social sphere
- ![](https://shawngraham.github.io/hist1900/assets/slides/model6.png)
	- with new techs, tehre are things that try to push it or take over it to make it safe

- with the telegraph, what're some of the "competences" required for it
	- what had to happen to have it
		- communicating beyond letters as an efficient method
		- industrialization
- admiralty says no
	- ralph wedgewood - comes up with scheme 1814; admiralty says no
		- change in electric lines
	- francis ronald - comes up with scheme 1816; admiralty says no
		- wires lapping his garden
			- later found out that it doesn't work in a line
			- clock face turning around with letters
- supervening social necessity
	- all the pieces were in place
	- especially the creation of galvanomete
	- the emergence of the railroad provides the necessity that the admiralty's blinked view could not
	- first passenger railway stockton-darling in UK, 1825
- 'oh what if we have two trains on the line at once?'
	- within a decade, hundreds of miles built
	- problem of communicating when the line is clear now pressing
		- 1838 edward davy
		- 1838 william cooke and charles wheatstone
		- cooke and wheatstone beat davy at the patent war
		- they both made systems with currents that allow them to communicate between trains (telegraphs electric)
		- 5 needles that aligned to light up a letter
		- was used past the creation of morse code
- samuel morse
	- he was mainly a painter
	- at yale, he took classes that intrigued him, one being electricity
	- found employment as an proffessor of the fine arts
	- could find a solution to long cords loosing their power
	- meets joseph henry, magnet guy
		- use of magnets as relays to keep the message going
	- his telegraph uses the galvanameter to record the reflections of the message
	- key to efficiency is code
	- its easier for us to learn code
	- easy for us to hear the differences between pulses and such that the receiver made
		- ticker tape
	- there was a prize to be claimed for a telegraph that can defend the coast
	- personal connections
	- laid pipes with wires along the railroad
		- it burnt out after the first tests
	- so he strung it one trees and buildings

	- pits in the paper so it can be read by deaf and blind
