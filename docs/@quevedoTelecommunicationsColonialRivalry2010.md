### Summary & Key Take Aways

Quevedo focuses on a specific case that occured during the cable wars in the 20th century. THis text covers how Germany struggled to have access with more parts of the world through cables without the restrictions of the British and the French. Germany attempted to  set its own cables, but due to the British's power over the industry, they made it difficult for Germany to do so so they could continue to have control over the cables.
