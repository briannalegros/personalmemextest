> The betrayals of that December stung me deeply, though, and it essentially split me into two people. I would be "Red Wolf" online, and no one would know about my young age or real name. I became a pretend 30-something, a move I [documented on my blog](https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/21/my-bbs-alter-ego-turns-45) in 2005. Offline, no one (except a trusted few) would know about my BBS life. That way, I could insulate myself from that kind of damage again. Recently, with the help of a therapist, I realized that the episode was the root of many trust issues that have carried over to this day.

I can relate to Edwards on some level because of a similar experience a few years ago. It's understandable wanting to keep your online life and offline life seperate, especially with our current day of age. With the internet, everything is permanent, so it's best to avoid any connection to your actual life in case something bad arises that may affect you in both worlds.
