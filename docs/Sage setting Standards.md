> When I was showing my computer, my first computer, and the old computers, when I asked, what makes the computers of the 1970s different from the computers in the 1940s? If you were to make a list, virtually everything you would come up with was pioneered by Sage. 
> 
> Sage computers had screens, they had video displays and graphics. 
> Sage computers had keyboards and handheld controls like those light guns. 
> Sage computers had magnetic core memory. 
> 
> They had parallel logic and multi processing, as opposed to serial processing. It was a technical distinction, but it was another big innovation. They could convert from analog to digital. They networked multiple computers, sending information over telephone lines. They simulated the real world in what was called real time. All these things, Sage brought them together.

While Sage was built a little too late for its original purpose, it laid a basis for the development of other computers, both for the military and for personal use. It's creation set a new standard for what computers should be and process like, allowing them to evolve in the direction that we have them as now today.
