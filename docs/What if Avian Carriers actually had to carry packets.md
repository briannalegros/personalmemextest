> In [computer networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network"), **IP over Avian Carriers** (**IPoAC**) is a joke proposal to carry [Internet Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol "Internet Protocol") (IP) [traffic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_traffic "Internet traffic") by [birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird "Bird") such as [homing pigeons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homing_pigeon "Homing pigeon").

It's funny to imagine information packets requested online to be carried avian carriers like how birds are used as messengers in fantansy medieval media like Game of Thrones. What if we didn't have technology to carry information through the cloud and we actually had to rely on avian carriers? Would take awhile for us to receive those packets over a long distance.
