> The concessions for telegraphic landings granted to foreign powers had lead toa worsening of the Spanish interests. Because of that, Spain could not enjoy thebenefits that the telegraphic circulation would have originated due to its uniquegeographical situation. For instance, the line to Dakar - which usually transmitted a very significant amount of messages to the west of Africa - was out of itscontrol. However, due to its own weakness in the imperialist context, it wasunable to get rid of those requests.

Weaker countries were at the mercy of the stronger countries. They were tasked at agreeing to demands in order to simply not cause issues with these countries, and were not even able to reap the rewards of the cables despite being on their land due to this difference in power.
