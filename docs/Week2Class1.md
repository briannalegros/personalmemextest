Mediums and Messages

- The impact of messages being received via different ways
	- what's the difference of receiving a message through email vs telephone
- Cave paintings
	- the ordeal of getting to the messages within the cave
		- we need to crawl through narrow spaces to get to it
	- the light flickering gives the paintings life
- the media in which the message is presented in affects the content of the message
- the medium is the message
	- sometimes the medium is more important than the message
- 'Medium' is something that carries something else
	- think about that relationship (the carrying)
	- it matters
- and media come in different classes or kinds of things
	- who decides that something is important?
	- whoever makes that decision gains importance/power themselves
	- to catalog brings power
	- shift in power when new media comes out
	- when media is out of bounds, it becomes open to being controlled
	- media extends our human cognition
- 'classifications both reflect and direct our thinking. The way we order represents the way we think'
	- stephen jay gould, 'the titular bishop of titiopolis'
- older text is written on sturdy objects that extends the past into the future
	- writing extends ourself into the future
	- the read and write these tablets show some sort of power (of knowledge?)
	- text has importance in power 
		- investment in having another person be able to study and learn to read these tablets
	- temples --> libraries
		- scribes writing
- alphabet symbols evolved over time into what we see and pronounce them today
- Mari
	- has an archive of over 3k letters in scripts
	- the city is arranged around it
- roman library
	- writing on more transportable item (papyrus, wax)
	- connected to pleasure during the roman empire
		- they described it as "refined leisure"
		- way to signal their refined taste
		- wasn't for learning and reading
	- they split by genre and author
		- personal and idiosyncratic organization
- the medium for a message is as important as the meassage
	- both for its affordances or what it permits to write, but also for how it extends our abilities to think/see the world in new ways
- how we classify media/messages has implications for power, control and discipline
	- reflects and directs or thinking
- art can be a medium for a message, realistically anything can be a medium for a message
	- this affects how the message is received and portrayed
- writing/counting intimately connected
- the infrastructure for writing spills out, has impacts on society
- libraries reflect the world back to itself
	- for why else would extremists attack library readings and book lists?
	- how the information is organized and available is important
		- related to power
- there is no 'natural' way to organize materials in a library
	- function of the power of the person who gets to make the classification
- moveable type
	- made of ceramic characters pressed on to paper
	- 1377 for the book Jikji (Korean)
		- one of the oldest surviving books according to wikipedia
	- like the later printing press
	- replication idea goes faster
	- allows faster reading and reproduction
- Melvil Dewey (1851-1931)
	- comes up with a way to organize the world's library
		- decimals numbers, because they're infinite
		- order of importance: philosophy, theology, phiology, nature(science, math), useful, fine arts, geography, biography, history
	- he took the way he viewed the world worked and turned it into a classification system that works and is used to this day
- the library of congress
	- organized in a way to help find things that are in their collection
	- this library ends up in universities, and colleges
	- reflects the bias of congress' interest
		- european christian bias
- all books are intertwined
	- they cite past ones and inspire future ones
- V bush
	- thinking beyond what the computer will be able to do
		- it had only been out for 5 years and could just do math
	- smashes classification schemes
		- imagines that documents will self organize
			- form connections on its own
			- bidirectional link
				- links within it to other documents
				- the document knows there are links linking to it
				- hypertext
					- project xanadox demonstrated it but was never finished
	- our intenert could've been amazing but there are many shitty websites
- hypertext because one way pointers
- no natural way for documents/information to be organized
	- there is no perfect scheme
	- those who do create their own pwoer
- people tried to find a 'natural' way to organize information
	- these categorizations ended up reifying the way they already believed the world to work
- in a north american context, the two big approaches hit at the same time there is massive public investment and expansion and reform of education
- proximity on shelves also enables a kind of discoverability
	- 'serendipity' it's sometimes called: but a function of a particular vision of the world, a reproduction of its norms
- invention of the digital computer happens not all that long after these massive reorganizations
- the digitization of knowledge is built by people for whom these categorizations/classifications of the world are normalized
- just like books, the internet inspires new ideas and creations
- physicality of messages/books has impacts in the world
	- this physicality has changed over time/ thus impacts in the world have changed
	- when new classifications shift, there's a shift in power too
	- every phase of the 'internet' that we shall see involves this shift
