### Summary & Key Take Aways

In this paper, Kumar discusses the changes in library catalogues throughout the ages and how they've evolved into the online catalogues we have today. Cataloguing use to be a private practice, but now has been adopted into many libraries and collections in the current age. Thanks to the digitalization of these collections, cataloguing has turned in to a sort of portal, transporting users to the exact item they seek.
