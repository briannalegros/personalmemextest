### Summary & Key Take Aways

Mike Caulfield goes over how many articles, websites, and any other source of internet found on the internet can be interconnected. He uses the metaphor of the [[Garden]] and the [[Stream]] to refer to how we find and explore sources of internet. Many of us yearn to venture through the [[Stream]] to find information about a particular subject, but we often come to a dead end as we lack those who can cultivate the [[Garden]].

This article makes mentions of [[@bushWeMayThink1945]]
