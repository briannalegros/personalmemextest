> "It was contended that the arrival of the printing press freed Western society form the fallibility of hand-copied books and initiated the next phase in communication."

This is an interesting way to look at it. Up until now, most communication with physical text was done between individuals and scholars as it was hard to have more than one copy of a physical text. With printing, it has allowed this information to be more widespread and has allowed information to reach more people, mostly regular citizens via newspapers.
