Sometimes it makes me sad that so much of our technological advancements were dedicated to destruction. - [Sophie](https://probablyanxious.github.io/hist1900-memex/Full%20Annotations/As%20We%20May%20Think%20-%20Annotations/)

I agree here with Sophie's thoughts. It's crazy to think that a lot of our history in technology is related to war time efforts, and that without these efforts we wouldn't have the type of technology we would have today. It makes me wonder where we would be if our technology was developed over peaceful times.
