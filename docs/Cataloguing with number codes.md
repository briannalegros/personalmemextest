> You dial a number and the machine selects and connects just one of a million possible stations. It doesnot run over them all. It pays attention only to a classgiven by a first digit, then only to a subclass of thisgiven by the second digit, and so on; and thus proceeds rapidly and almost unerringly to the selectedstation

I believe this is talking about telephone area codes. We still use this system to categorize different items, especially with IDs. This system helps us easily search up items in catalogs via programs on the computer.
