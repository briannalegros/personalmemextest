### Summary & Key Take Aways

Maggie Appleton talks about the [[Garden]] similarly to [Mike Caulfield]([[@mikecaulfieldGardenStreamTechnopastoral2015]]), who was mentioned in the post itself. The website she hosts this post on is used similarly to our Memexs. In her post, she goes over [[Digital Gardening]] and it's many benefits that it can provide us if adopted at a larger scale. She also goes over the history of [[Digital Gardening]], and why it wasn't adopted as widely. She encourages her readers to adopted this style of navigating the internet as it provides better way to store and share knowledge, which is what she believes the internet should be. She also includes ways and tips to use when creating your personal Garden, or Memex.
