> "The four edges of the page, perhaps papyrus, parchment, or paper, tell both the designer and reader where the space of communication begins and ends. As a single sheet, the page may stand free of an obvious attachment with others of its kind. The material boundaries of the solitary page not only circumscribe the space of communication, they also circumscribe the message itself: there is nothing more to be read than what is on the page."

How do we know that there isn't more beyond a single page? How do we know where the page begins and ends. It's interesting the way we've been taught to treat pages, if they have no numbers, then there is no other pages that accompany it. If the paragraph ends, then the next one will shift topic.
