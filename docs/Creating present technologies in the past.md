> Had a Pharaoh been given detailed and explicit designs of an automobile, and had he understood them completely, it would have taxed the resources of his kingdom to have fashioned the thousands of parts for a single car, andthat car would have broken down on the first trip to Giza.

No matter how detailed the instructions to create an invention was, some were just unable to be made at the time due to the lack of progression of the human race. Try all they might, these inventions wouldn't be able to be as efficient as they could be until more development could be made in relation to their creation.
