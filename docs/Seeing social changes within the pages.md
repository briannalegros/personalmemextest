> "Because papyrus was an important resource for communities living around the Mediterranean, change in the manufacture of papyrus-based products can be considered indications of broader social change. Indeed, E.G. Turner observed a shift in writing material of the first century AD, when papyrus sheets became larger but were of lesser quality than their forebears: stalks that would previously have been discarded were beginning to be used for writing material in the later period. The use of stems that had once been regarded as substandard suggests that manufacturers were responding to the economic climate of the Mediterranean basin, where the cultivation of papyrus could not keep up with growing demand."

With just observing the changes of papyrus paper over time, we were able to understand and see a social change within the societies that manufactured them. As the papyrus grew more popular, manufacturers had to become more efficient with their resources to keep up with the demand, even if it meant cutting some corners. It really shows how changes in objects of an era can help us see social changes within societies of that time.
