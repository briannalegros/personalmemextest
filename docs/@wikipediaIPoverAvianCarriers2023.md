### Summary & Key Take Aways

This Wikipedia page covers the idea of Avian Carriers being able to transport packets of data instead over over the cloud. Initially it was an April Fools joke, but then evolved into something that was actually studied. Honestly I thought it was some joke at first, but reading further into it, it really shows the idea as an actual possibility for technology.
