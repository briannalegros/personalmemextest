> Dewey peppered him with questions, especially concerning classification. "He puts the books on the horse under 'horse' & not under 'zoology.'" Dewey believed most people with only rudimentary reading skills would think the same way.

Today, when people are thinking about a subject, they'll search up the exact thing they're looking for. With specifically the example with the horse, someone who's looking to learn more about horses will most likely search up horse rather than zoology, since horse is the first thing that comes to mind about the research topic.
