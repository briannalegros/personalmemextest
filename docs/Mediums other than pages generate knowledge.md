> Gardens are not just a collection of interlinked words. While linear writing is an incredible medium that has served us well for a little over 5000 years, it is daft to pretend working in a single medium is a sufficient way to explore complex ideas.
> 
> It is also absurd to ignore the fact we're living in an audio-visual cornucopia that the web makes possible. Podcasts, videos, diagrams, illustrations, interactive web animations, academic papers, tweets, rough sketches, and code snippets should all live and grow in the garden.

In school, we've been molded to only look at academic papers and websites rather than other mediums. In reality, all forms of media, be it videos, images, games, and so on are able to generate thoughts and knowledge that can implemented into our garden.
