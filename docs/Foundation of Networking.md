The [[Redundancy System]] brought the foundation of how networking for the internet would be. This system allows multiple devices (computers, consoles, mobile devices, and so on) to communicate directly with the exact device they wish to pull information from, whether it be for browsing, texting, or playing a game with other players. This makes it so that these devices don't have to rely on other unrelated devices to complete a query, or have to deal with a million requests at a time when it is unnecessary.
