Can you keep a secret?

- cryptology: systems for 'secret' writing
- cryptanalysis: systems for revealing those secrets
- Kahn
	- secret messages have emerged in multiple places at once
	- privacy between two or more people
- Duely
	- story of spy in the american revolution
	- woman wanted to get a letter to a british officer
	- gave it to her ex-husband
	- the letter was encrypted
- draw out the 'assemblage' of ideas that makes that story intelligible. what things must come together for such a story to have happened?
	- why do they have the knowledge of the secret codes
	- what cypher? substitution
	- privacy concerns
- london 1772
	- blog post that opened to network analysis
- we don't need to decypher the message, sometimes it's enough to map who is communicating with who
- pattern of how that message moves can be important
- a code: variable sized elements that have meaning in the plaintext language - syllables, words, phrases (Dooley); thousands of substitutions
- a cipher: a transformation from plaintext according to some transformation (Dooley, 5-6); 'small fixed number of substitution elements'
- polybius
	- c 200 - c 118 BC
	- using torches to transmit a message (one indicating the row and the placement)
	- scytale long string of letters down the rods to encode a message
- Julius Ceaser
	- caeser shift
	- write out the alphabet and you shift it over (by 5)
- Al-Kindi (one of the great philosophers)
	- treaties on cryptology
		- on extracting obscured correspondence
	- explains how to defeat the ciphers
	- find common letters and work back from that
- in europe
	- roger bacon (13th century) describes various systems of secret writing known to him; may also have encrypted the secret of the philosopher's stone in the same descriotion using a grille (piece of card with holes cut out, fits over the page, reveals words)
	- otherwise, fairly behind
- early modern europe (16th to 1800ish)
	- remember, intro of a new inromation technology in europe (moveable type) is also a marker for this period
	- faster circulation of ideas
	- new ideas around relationship of people to god, to each other, nature of government, what is a state, anyway... all these things up for discussion
	- coinciding with the european age of discovery too...
- francis bacon and the bi-literal cipher
	- you can make a cipher out of 2 letters
	- many combinations possible (256)(2^8)
	- similar to binary
- nomenclators
	- mixture of substitution cyphers and codebooks
	- still susceptible to frequency analysus and context-dependent guessing
	- popular in diplomatic circles 1400- to about 1800
	- Mary Queen of Scotts- nomeclator broken, her attempt to seize power thwarted
- alphabet square
	- sentence to encode another sentence
- french revolution
	- arm machine that helped encode messages
	- 2 arms with 2 arms themselves
	- the 2 main arms had 4 possible angles
	- secondary arms had 7 possible angles
	- 196 possible symbols
- take away
	- where are the gaps?
	- where are the women in the story?
	- who/what is left out?
	- what other things had to have happened to support all this
	- remember the becht poem from alst week
	- messages are never one to one, they can be distorted and abbreviated away from the original meaning
