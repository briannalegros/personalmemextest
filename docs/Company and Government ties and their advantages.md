> The most important customers were the pressand the news agencies. So important were cables that the news-agencyentrepreneur Julius Reuter laid his own cable in 1866 from Lowestoft(Suffolk) to Nordeney on the North Sea coast of Germany. Three yearslater, he sponsored and invested in a cable from France to the UnitedStates. Though he withdrew from the cable business in the early 1870s,his news agency maintained very close relations with the cable compa-nies in order to secure lower rates and priority access.

Creating these corporate ties allowed both to have advantages from their relationships. The lower rates and priority access to the news agency allowed them to communicate with each other to better have access to news sources. Then for the cable agency they received funding as well as good press from the news agency.
