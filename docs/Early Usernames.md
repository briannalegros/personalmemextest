> Before I started, though, I needed a special name. Many people in the BBS world had a cool alias that they used instead of their real names. Handles like "Gorgon Horror," "The Wizard," and "Einstein" were common. My brother's name was "Blue Dragon," and his favorite color was blue. My favorite color was red, so I picked "Red Wolf." I liked wolves.

The start of when people began to use usernames. This thought process for deciding a name is important, but is typically related to what we like or relate to ourselves. Usernames are what we're going to be referred to as, so might as well make it something we like.
