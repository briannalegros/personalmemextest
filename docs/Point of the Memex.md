> The Garden is what I was doing in the wiki as I added the Gun Control articles, building out a network of often conflicting information into a web that can generate insights, iterating it, allowing that to grow into something bigger than a single event, a single narrative, or single meaning.

This is related to what the point of our memex is. Creating a network of information that allows the creation and finding of new knowledge by intertwining sources.
