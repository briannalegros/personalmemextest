<li>Reaching the limit of technology</li> </ul> <p>I have many notes featured in my Memex. After reviewing my graph showcasing this collection of notes that I have created throughout the term, I have come to realize that the overarching theme of these notes revolve around the evolution of technology over the years and it's relation to society.</p> <p>The earliest forms of technology that are mentioned in my Memex are about pages. Pages refers to pieces of paper. Before we had access to technology like computers and the internet, people preserved their knowledgeand stories on these papers which would evolve from being stone tablets. These pages would be able preserve the knowledge written on them, but also be able to preserve the social elements of society at the time of it's creation in both the writing and the construction of the page itself.</p> <p>Much of our knowledge before computers and the internet was written on these pages, it was important for society to maintain and find ways to preserve these pages, otherwise we would lose knowledge that we had accumulated. Once we had found better ways to store this information, the knowledge on these pages would be digitalized and uploaded on to the internet.</p> <p>The internet over time due from the existing accumulated knowledge and the new information that would be uploaded to it daily turned it into a treasure trove of information. Thanks to the internet, it allowed easier access to this information to everyone, allowing society to focus on making advancements in areas that would allow completing tasks more efficiently through the creation of new technology. With these advancements, it has allowed society to spend less time on simple tasks and work on creating even more advancements to improve life with the improvement and creation of even more technology.</p> <p>With more improvements in technology, the perspective of distance and time begins to shorten. The introduction of telephone cables was one of the biggest leaps since the introduction of cars and steam boats that allowed a change in the perspective of distance in a long time. These cables allowed communication over a long distance in real-time, so there was little need to send messagers overseas. These were the first seeds that would lead to globalization now due to how easy it was to communicate between different countries, which also resulted in the standardization of keeping time. These advancements in communication would prove to be useful during wartime efforts, which led to many of these companies to be funded and even controlled by their country's government.</p> <p>Much of the later technology that would be created would be due to certain world events, mainly by governments for war. This technology would be modelled in such a way that it would be used in order to help with war efforts, most notably Sage during the Cold War. In Professor MacDougall's lecture \"How the Cold War Created Video Games and Vise Versa,\" it was noted that Sage was built in order to help predict the path of missles, but it was created a little too late to properly complete it's original purpose. However Sage had the appearance of what we now know today as computers, it was used as a basis for creating new technology which eventually led to becoming computers.</p> <p>The technology developed by the military would eventually be changed and be given different uses. These changes would eventually be brought on to the market for anyone to buy. Much of our technology has been created due to certain needs of society. These needs influence what technology is made and what it is made for.</p> <p>These technologies get shown to be useful at improving our lives, whether it be as simple as being able to carry more items in a sturdier wagon or a computer allowing users to send each other emails. As a technology becomes more widely used, society needs to start getting use to these technologies. As we adapt more to the technology, it becomes more and more integrated with our daily lives to where it becomes mundane. Once we've adapted to the technology, there is a need to improve upon the technology as society wishes to more jobs easier.</p> <p>Society asks for improvements in its existing technology to further benefit their daily lives, it is not always that a technology is used for its intended purpose. While most technology is developed for a certain use, ultimately it is up to the user to give its use. Computers were initially designed for the military to do advance processes so they could be done faster and more efficiently than humans, however these processes led to the creation of video games and the internet. </p> <p>These uses that the users create for the technology couldn't be done without the choices that it's creator made. What is decided for the technology and its capabilities ultimately dictate whether the technology will be able to do one thing or another, and this standard will follow throughout its lifetime of advancements and iterations.</p> <p>Many of our technologies, most noteably Sage being the earliest form of computer, have been created or modelled for the use of the military during war. Even existing technologies with a different original purpose like the telephone cables were funded by the military and used to improve efforts during war. The military would pour a lot of money into making these technologies, which ultimately impacted the way these technologies evolved.</p> <p>These technologies created for war are a reflection of the things that society has found to be important. In a sense, it was important to society to create these technologies to give them an advantage during war in order to protect their society. The advancements made in technology reflects this, as there is a need for entertainment that can be found in video games and the need to simplify work through various computer programs.</p> <p>Sometimes it can be seen that there are many new developments made in the advancements of our technology that we can underestimate the effort put into these new findings. A lot of funding and research must go in to the creation of new technology, it is not something that can happen overnight. As we continue to develop and grow as a society, we gain access to more knowledge and resources, that lead to the creation even more technology. More advancements in technology leads to more intricate and complex machines that allow the completion of the task (or tasks) that it has been created to complete.</p> <p>The technology we create is limited the resources existing on Earth. If we are to use up all of a specific resource, then we may not be able to create other potential technologies that we could have with that resource. This happened with the gutta percha, where it was all used up to create telephone wires. It is important that we preserve our natural resources and search for alternatives with our resources in order to continue expanding our knowledge to create more technologies.</p> <p>As we are restricted by our resources, we are also restricted by our knowledge. Many technologies that exist today could no have existed in the past because the society of the past lacked the knowledge and technology to be able to create them. Even today, this dilemma continues to exist. Our knowledge and technology can only bring us to a certain point in the creation of even newer technology. If we want to continue creating more technology that's even better than our existing technology, it is up to us to research and create the means to be able to improve our technology.</p> <p>As our society evolves, we create more and more technology that better suits our lifestyles and helps improve it. The creation of our technology is dictated by the needs of society, which influences the technology that is created and the path that is taken towards its advancements. Our lives have become so intertwined by the introduction of various new technologies throughout the ages that improve how we live our lives. In Professor MacDougall's lecture mentioned previously, he mentions that the technology we create are tools create for knowledge by knowledge. Essentially, the technology we create technology is restricted by our knowledge, and the creation of technology is restricted by our knowledge. The two work together to improve one another, creating more advance technology and improving society's lifestyle.</p>"},{"location":"0_Final%20Journey_2/","title":"Compile another Journey through your notes to assess that desire (goals of the course): was it accomplished?

Reviewing my first Final Journey question, I found that the evolution of technology was heavily influenced by society. I touched on how society's decisions influenced technology's advancements and how in turn this affected society, but here I will go more in depth on how technology has influenced today's society.</p> <p>As technology gets more advanced, it becomes more and more used to where in some way we are pretty much required to own certain technologies if we wish to keep up with society. When telephone cables were introduced, they impacted society as a whole just because of how useful they were. At some point, everyone needed to own one because if you wanted to keep up with everyone. Because of this, it was necessary that we adopted these technologies into our daily lives, which also requires us to get use to how these technologies work. Even then, everytime a new technology gets revealed and released, they too start to become part of our daily lives and then require us to learn how to use them as well. </p> <p>Because technology, we become more and more used to them because they are so useful. They've allowed us to put time into other things and still be able to create items that would normally take longer without the technology. We've become so dependant on technology that it has become part of our culture. When a new technology releases (new iPhone or video game for example), there are often lines of people waiting to pick one up for themselves. Often when new devices or hardware gets released, it is more efficient than it's predecessor. This leads to a wave of people who exchange their previous one for the new advanced one with all its new features.</p> <p>With new technology, our perspective of the relation between time and distance begins to shorten. Technology offers shortcuts that allow the distribution of items to be done faster over larger distances. For examples, telephone cables have allowed us to communicate with people across the country and overseas and vehicles have allowed us to transport different items across the world. This has allowed us to transport material to different factories across the world. This essentially turns the Earth into it's own factory. We use different materials found all over the world which allows us to create several new technologies due to their properties and what we can turn them into. </p> <p>Having all of this technology has allowed countries to work together in creating them. These items and technologies created in factories from all around the world get distributed to various countries. The industry has caused the globalization of various customs that surround both the market in buying and selling these items as well as using them. These customs get woven into our cultures and become part of our lives. As more and more technology gets created and introduced into our lives, the more it leaves an impact with how efficient it is at completing various tasks.</p> <p>My Memex and the sources I have read have been able to demonstrate both the impact of technology on society and the impact of society on technology. It has shown me that the two work together in shaping our current society and how we live our lives. Technology has become an extremely important aspect of our lives. The impact of these two should be researched more, as how they affect each other have proven to me to be quite interesting.</p>"},{"location":"%40appletonABriefHistory%26EthosoftheDigitalGarden2020/","title":"@appletonABriefHistory&EthosoftheDigitalGarden2020","text":"<p>Title: @appletonABriefHistory&amp;EthosoftheDigitalGarden2020 date: 2023-04-04 type: reference project:</p> <p>tags:: projects:</p>"},{"location":"%40appletonABriefHistory%26EthosoftheDigitalGarden2020/#reference","title":"Reference","text":"<p>Appleton, M. 2020.

The\u00a0Hungry Beast\u00a0team took up the challenge after a fiery parliament session wherein the government of the time blasted the opposition for not supporting telecommunications investments, saying that if the opposition had their way, Australians would be doing data transfer over carrier pigeons. The\u00a0Hungry Beast\u00a0team had read about the South African experiment and assumed that, as a developed western country, Australia would have higher speeds. The experiment had the team transfer a 700 MB file via three delivery methods to determine which was the fastest: a carrier pigeon with a microSD card, a car carrying a\u00a0USB stick, and a\u00a0Telstra\u00a0(Australia's largest telecom provider) ADSL line. The data was to be transferred from\u00a0Tarana\u00a0in rural\u00a0New South Wales\u00a0to the western-Sydney\u00a0suburb of\u00a0Prospect, New South Wales, a distance of 132 kilometres (82\u00a0mi) by road. Approximately halfway through the race, the internet connection unexpectedly dropped and the transfer had to be restarted. The pigeon won the race with a time of approximately 1 hour 5 minutes, the car came in second at 2 hours 10 minutes, while the internet transfer did not finish, having dropped out a second time and not coming back. The estimated time to upload completion at one point was as high as 9 hours, and at no point did the estimated upload time fall below 4 hours.[14]</p> <p>Here I thought the pigeon would be the slowest. We overestimate technology because we are so use to it that we assume that it's more efficient than other methods. In the race situation, the pigeon was able to avoid traffic and not have to worry about the internet going down, avoiding any redundancy. Of course there are the potential risks of losing the pigeon entirely and the fact that it could lose the SD card, which makes it a very risky method and why we don't use it today.</p>"},{"location":"Are%20Avian%20Carriers%20really%20more%20efficient/#citational-information","title":"Citational Information","text":"<p>@wikipediaIPoverAvianCarriers2023</p>"},{"location":"Are%20Avian%20Carriers%20really%20more%20efficient/#related-links","title":"Related Links","text":"<p>Technology changing time and space Sometimes our knowledge isn't enough Standardization of keeping time Change in communication Long distance communication in the war Who has control over communication Packs lead to Efficient Communication Over the Internet Technology completes tasks more efficiently Technology and Society Technology improves and hinders Technology evolving along with society What Technology could have been Our role with Technology Users make the purpose of technology Getting use to technology The Complexity of Technology Reaching the limit of technology Actually implementing Avian Carriers to transport packets What if Avian Carriers actually had to carry packets Difference in efficiency between nature and digital Avian carriers pros and cons Avain Carriers instead of drones</p>"},{"location":"Automated%20cash%20registers/","title":"Automated cash registers","text":"<p>tags:: #technology #access projects::</p> <p>The salesman places on a stand the customer\u2019s identification card, his own card, and the card taken from the article sold \u2014 all punched cards.

the human computer could do</p> <p>John von Neumann - mathematician who contributed across multiple fields - heavily involved with the Manhattan Project, early digital computations and a professor with the Instute for advanced study in princeton - in a report in 1945, he makes a connection between the use of the telephone relay technology with the way neurons work in animal brains     - can be in discrete state     - explicitly makes the connection between switches/bits/information and cognition - long tradition in western thought where we think of the human through the metaphor of whatever technology is dominant     - mechanemorphism     - works the other way too</p> <p>Babbage - turing framed his language of universal machine to pay hommage to babbage - the machine was to use punch card - one set had the instructions, other had the data to work on - inputting the data kept it in store - computing done in the mill     - jumps between the mill and support     - prints out the results</p> <p>Georg Scheutz - builds babbage's difference engine in 1844 - used in labs and some government offices - second half of the 19th century lead to the emergence of corporations and other devices starting to change things</p> <p>Kelvin - parallel kinds of computing deices, the analogue simulators - kelvin's tide calculator for different points around the world - kelvin proposes in 1876 a way of linking several similar devices together physically to simuate differential equations - the mechanisms to achieve this not developed until 1920s, and bush - other groups replicate bush's work     - 8 of these analogue computers around the world in the 1930s     - includes the us where they used to calculate ballistic trajectors under different conditions</p> <p>PRogramming the machines - literally bashing them into different shapes with hammers and wrenches - useful for scientific analysis - IBM counters and tabulators meeting business needs     - it could add, substract, multiply     - other machines/prototypes could retrieve and photocopy data held on a 35mm film - business had sophisticated machines, academics had sophisticated machines, no real burning market need for a machine that could alter its own program - Edwin Black's IBM and the Holocaust     - germany being its 2nd bigest market     - happy to sell it to them despite the calls for boycots     - pumping money into tis german subsideray to help with 1933 german census         - the nazis use this to start ethnic identity programs</p> <p>George Stibitz (Bell LAbs) 1937 - Leondardo Torres y Quevedo 1915     - suggests using telephones switches to control the operation of his mechanical calculator - Stibitz 1937     - uses telephone relays over a weekend to wire a simple logic circuit to perform binary addition     - wins him some funding to build the first complex calculator (Model 1 finished by 1940) - demo where he performs a remote calculation over a telephone line - over the war he builds electromechanical calculators     - eahc more sophisticated, but still tuned for one task     - model 2 tested anti aircraft detectors     - model 3 anit aircraft ballistics - 1950 this line of research is eclipsed by all electrical machines</p> <p>Konrad Zuse 1936 - building electromachanical binary calculators from telephone parts - achieves no business success with these - joins wehrmacht in 1939     - aerodynamics research institute     - spots his calculator work     - relieves him of his active duty and sends him back to his engineering job to build the S1 (calculator to speed missile production)     - 1943 he starts his own firm with support from air ministry         - develops the z3         - programmable but uses 35 mm film with holes in it         - can store 64 binary digits         - flees berling in 1945 with his z4         - caputred near the austrian border</p> <p>Howard Aitken - prof at harvard - designed his own electromechanical calculator to help with his thesis work - proposes the machine to the military in 1937     - they said no but after reviewing what the egineer wanted it, they introduced aitken to ibm and thomas watson - watson saw aitken as a way to sell the navy tabulating machines - 1939 navy and ibm funded aitken to build electromagentic machine at harvard     - his staff come from the navy too, including grace hopper - first machine mar 1 given to ahrvard as a gift     - he wanted a honorary degree but they ignored him - aitken sees watson as a nuisance     - watson saw it as public relations</p> <p>Existing 'social necessity' good enough for electrico-mechanical calculators, not enough for all-purpose general computers - they worked     - they did calculations, could be tuned towards different tasks, but didn't operate on symbols or change their programming in reaction to their own calculations - WW2 and the cold war provided the impetus     - pulled all the strands from the term together</p> <p>Ballistics - industrialization of war over the 19th century lead to the new types of guns and firepower - Reverend FRancis Bashfort     - experiements related to air drag and velocity 1864-1880     - produces the first firing tables - us military after the civil war establishes testing ranges to train ballistic officers and work out tables for different kinds of guns - you need to know waht angle, how much  powder, temperature, humidity, etc. to drop the shell on the enemy - tables calculated by hand     - typically women     - naval observatory 'harem' guy late 19th/early 20th     - more guns lead to more conditions of use emerging during the war than the computer could keep up with - had to tabulate dozens of factors for 1000s of possible trajectories, each one half day's work - kilogirls, cheeky unit of emasurement of 1000 hours of work by a woman computer - 15 tables being produced a week but needed 40</p> <p>Mauchly and ENIAC - electronic numerical integrator and calculator/computer - prof at urinus college     - interested in meteorology     - despairing at the calculations too a summer course at moore school of electrical enegineering in 1941         - learn about electronic device          - he had a paper by john atansoff describing the deisgn of an electronic calculator he was building         - instead of relats he would use vacuum tube valves         - in summer 1941, mauchly visits atansoff and learn more about it - mauchly writes a memo 'the use of high speed vacuum tube devices for calculating'     - memo gets lost but herman goldstine naval attache officer working at the moore school     - overseeing ballist firing table generation on an analogu differential analyzer mentions it to the operator as pergaps a better way of doing it     - secretary reconstructs it and theyw ant to use the idea - 3 years to build     - took 20 seconds to calculate     - first programmable, electronic, general purpose computer</p> <p>Women - the computers were girls - they broke the problems up and did the math - the girls figured out how to put the problem on it - they had to understand both pure math and engineering - 1881 pickering didn't like work ethic of his hired help, his hired his housemaid as a computer-wilhelmina fleming     - fleming eventually supervises 80 other women of 36 years working - these women were skilled and talented mathmaticians and astronomrerss</p> <p>Lovelace - she couldn't publish her own thoguhts so she did so through annotations while translating the work of the italian scholar Menebrae - wrote so much that it was 3 time the length of the article - describes how to set babbage's engine in train     - in order to calculate things like bernoulli numbers     - conceptualizes how other kinds of things might get compted - thinking in terms of symbolic logic - she died of uterine cancer at 36 - her work fades away - she had to understand its engineering completely - babbage had to figure out how to add, substract, etc. lovelace had the harder job</p> <p>Grace Hopper - mathematics prof at vassar - joins war effort in navy - she ends up working for aitken     - he hands her a complex set of equations - she studies wiring diagrams, card reader manuals, whatever existed - mark 1 is a paper tape machine, so every algorith is linear, no loops - she writes the manua; for the machine and its successors (500 pages)     - doesn't get her name on it</p> <p>use of bug to indicate something gone wrong in machinery had been used for decades, does not origiante in computing, but this was perhaps the first literal case of a programming bug</p> <p>ENIAC SIX - betty holberton, jean jennings abrtik, kay mcnulty, marlyn wescoff meitzer, ruth lichterman and frances bilas spence - had to track each piece of data, wire it into a panel, such as a multiplier or a \u2018square rooter,\u2019 and then move the result \u2014 physically by wire \u2014 to another panel for storage,\u201d she said - had to keep track of steps and diagrams for the wires manually     - pedaling sheets - could handle branching logic and loops - write the first algorithms that could write their own algorithms - come up with idea of subroutines and packaging little pieces of code together for reuse - assigning symbolic letters/numbers to these to speed up programming work - MCC company with women in positions of authority     - not a good business though     - bought by rand in 1950     - women had to work in a hierarchy and report to men who didn't know what was happening     - salesmen couldn't figure out how to sell themachines         - the women sold 40 in a year when they expected 6     - </p>"},{"location":"Week%208%20Class%202/","title":"Week 8 Class 2","text":"<p>Computational Incunabula: The BRitish Experience</p>

no letter could be encryphered as itself     - this enventually is the crack into the wedges driven to break the codes - polish government sees what's coming down the pipe     - they broke 3 roto machine by mid 30s         - week sbefore the invasion     - they shared what they knew with the french and germans     - created a machine called the Bombas, basically reverse engineered the enigma         - was no longer useful every time they added rotors to enigma</p> <p>Hut 8 and Bletchly Park - government code and cypher school - turing and his crew worked here on the problem of crack the naval enigma machines     - they knew in principles and had a good idea of its designs - turing et al worked to improve the bombe machines     - sepcilized calculators to breal the codes - dozen of mathemeticians, 4 linguists and 100+ others who apparently were all women - simpler machines were what most specialized electro-mechanical devices were what Zuse, Aitken and Mauchly     - the need was much greater - they focused on probable words     - they were used as keys to set the rotors up     - plaintext was used in some messages     - the context eventually gave them a method to start to test possible keys     - they'd sometimes spot messages that were less secure being resent on more secure machines         - breaking it on a lesser machine would give a key to a stronger - bombe would churn through the possibilities     - in 1941 they could crack a message a day - 1942 germans added another rotor     - allies didn't know until a radio operator sent a message with one wheel turned off     - he then corrected himself and sent the same message again with the wheel turned on, revealing existence of a new wheel</p> <p>\"It was luck the security people didn't know [about Turing being gay] early on, because if they had known, he might not have obtained his clearnace and we might have lost the war\"  -

integrated valves of the key - german encyption required more powerful devices as they kept improving their machines - the british build a device that can do boolean operations     - too similar to the analogue computers of Vannevar Bush     - also involves valves and relays and paper tape readers - was a rickety device, it didn;t have to be pretty, it just needed to work - they worked on how to store the patterns to help search for more encoded messages in valves     - so the messages they were intercepting could just be put on the same machine - 1943 allies were able to neutralize german encryption again     - shaves off 2-3 years of the war - ENIAC and Colossus sit astride the phase transition from powerful calculators to full-on computers - the difference is that a full on computer needs a datastore      - where its operating instructions are held     - can be varied because of the calculation</p> <p>Post War Developments Doldrums - multiple teams are exploring these machines that sit on the calculator/computer barrier - von Neumann write the 'First Draft of a Report on The EDVAC' 1945 - but for the most part, the urgency is gone; everyone losing steam, in terms of computing design - last technical hurdle to solve is the problem of memory - von Neumann's paper circulates widely     - describes the kinds of things a computer should have     - a writer said \"It was as if, in the early 1890s, somebody had specified, in some detail, the fundamental design elements of an automobile - and that this document acted prescriptevily to limit the range of options available to engineers int he decades following\" - influenced turing, Mauchely, the Institute of Advanced Studies in Princeton, anyone who was into these devices read the report</p> <p>From one supervening necessity to another -

the navy lost interest     - airforce takes over the project         - only machine that could plot intercept courses for strategic long range bombers     - solved the problem of magnetic memory     - rejigged for real-time output and parallel processing         - it could display its output on an oscilloscope in real time     - it became the core of airdefense in NA - led by Jay Forrester     - devlops key ideas in system dynamics     - this inspired Will Wright         - encodes these into Sim City     - he had dodgy ideas about urban values         - those regressive ideas have now informed generations of gamers - cold war provided new supervening necessity     - new weapons, new simulators, new global-spanning aircrafts, missels and space all require computing power - first ocmputer installed at the institute for advanced study in princeton     - ready to go by 1951     - one problem came from the Los Alamos nuclear folks, running 60 days 24/hrs a day - the us had its research and industrial/military work distributed across labs and competitive research groups, many computers emerge, largely based on the design of the machine at IAS     - all these mechaines have been programmed     - the programming aproach for each designed and developed from scrastch - soviet detonate atomic bomb in 1949     - americans respond with h bomb in 1952     - we need digital computers</p> <p>MEanwhile in Britain - manchester baby - built to test another solution to the problem of memory - runs a stored program from memory in 1948     - another first computer moment - the idea tjat all computers had to be big and monsterous meant that the machines that were quickly designed and relatively small despite working couldn't take off     - remained a curiosity     - returned to building big room filling machines</p> <p>Allies no longer sharing info - act of congress in 1946     - closes off data sharing with allies over nuclear work - briatin sets out to build its own now that they're shut off - decides that all experiences should be centralised at the the national physical laboratory - the official british computer will be built at the NPL and they turn to Turing to make it     - names it the automatic computing engine as a hat tip to babbage - work at manchester shows how successful britain's boffins were at controlling things     - only got funding for the machines by saying it;d be used for physics and math research         - similar gambit that von neumann used for getting computing work at the institute for adavanced studies in the us     - minor official in the bureaucracy decided however that there was no use ACE and worked to obstruct turing     - because of the official secrets act, Turing couldn't explain to this bureaucrat the signifance of what he was trying to do</p> <p>Death of Alan Turing - turing moves to manchester to work on computing 1948 - his house got burgled     - he calls the police     - his partner said that he thinks its a certain guy so he relays this to the police     - he gets found out as a homosexual     - he found guilty of gross indecency         - was given a choice between imprisonment or probation with chemical castration     - he loses security clearances, chooses castration     - commits suicide 1954     - pardoned in 2012     - this guy saved britain     - this made it so that britain couldn't trust people who were in secrecy     - this paranoia destroyed britain's domestic computing industry         -

ethernet cable         - part of the solution         - high speed cables for computer to computer communication     - internet was for secure communication during wars         - idea of adapting all the networks for wartime - cerf and kahn oversee a series of meetings and seminar to hammer out details amongst interested parties     - datagrams from cyclades     - error correction and random access from ethernet/alohanet     - no more imps or network control protocol         - the host itself has to handle this     - transmission control protocol (TCP) hammered out by 1973 - the boundaries between networks, the creation of gateways     - companies emerge to physically handle the gateways     - we want the distance to be as short as possible for faster connection     - special computer to handle packets from sent between networks</p> <p>1978: TCP splits into TCP/IP - split into 2 protocols - TCP as a blueprint for computers talking together - IPs for how the data gets shared between them     - firewalls itnerrupt this - both make the least amount of assumptions - more protocols out there     - x.25 one of the prominent ones in canada at the time - real birth of the internet nov. 27 1977     - computer on teh highway that sends a message     - PRNET to ARPANET gateway     - then  travels through ARPANET to the east coast     - then satelite uplink through SATNET gateway     - then travels through SATNET to europe     - then travels back to a computer in Santa Barbara via ARPANE - BBN starts packaging TCP/IP into unix operationg systems     - gets incorporated into other machinery too, inclduing IBM machines     - most hosts on ARPANET continued to putter along with the original specification         - they were happy talking amongst themselves     - decision from high:         - shift to the TCP/IP by january 1983 or be cut out of ARPANET entirely     - DCA was worried about the growth making it easy to hack into the network         - decided to split military arpanodes out of it into a MILNET         - means figuring out exactly which computers/hosts/IMPs, phone lines are military, which are not and so on</p> <p>Summary -   before you can internet, you need to network -   users have to find a reason to use -   your users aren't who you might think they are -   what they'll use it for isn't what you think it'll be -   simpler wins out over complex -   military &amp; politics are always in the background -   the internet is 'invented' 1973-1983 -   Internet Culture is happening at the same time, and not even mostly on ARPANET</p>"},{"location":"Week1Class1/","title":"Week1Class1","text":"<ul> <li>There is more to the internet than we see</li> <li>Technically has roots in the roman empire</li> <li>There are issues in human communication that have existed since we began writing things down</li> </ul> <p>Class website: shawngraham.github.io/hist1900</p>"},{"location":"Week1Class2/","title":"Week1Class2","text":"<p>Archaeology -
