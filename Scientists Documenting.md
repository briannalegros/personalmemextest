> One can now picture a future investigator in his laboratory. His hands are free, and he is not anchored. As he moves about and observes, he photographs and comments. Time is automatically recorded to tie the two records together. If he goes into the field, he may be connected by radio to his recorder. As he ponders over his notes in the evening, he again talks his comments into the record. His typed record, as wellas his photographs, may both be in miniature, so that he projects them for examination.

This scenario, you could turn into the scientist using a video camera, which many use to this day to document findings. There are programs that autogenerate scripts from videos, which can be used to have a physical copy, however this technology isn't that reliable yet
