> "Whether thick, thin, brittle, smooth, dog-eared, or stained, every page discloses a unique identity that has been shaped by cultural forces over time. This identity is susceptible to change across different reading communities, but the material cues provided by the page perdure and are always present in the transmission of ideas. Designers make calculated decisions regarding the size, shape, colour, and quality of the material to suggest readers what kind of page it is and how they wish to be treated. Although a handwritten folio of animal skin in a medieval manuscript is as much a page as the leaf of a mass-produced paperback, the characteristics of each communicate vastly different messages about their respective manufacture, circulation, and cultural value. In this way, the construction of the page can be read as evidence of its social history."

It's really important how we display our text. Depending on how we presented, it can be taken in different ways. The visual elements of a page are wildly important with how you want your text to be taken, this includes the material it's on and the types of fonts you use. The news uses easy to read fonts and short sentences to describe items while fancier fonts are used for more serious texts like textbooks and scientific journals. The item that the text is written on also wildly affects how it may be perceived, with the Romans and Greeks using stone tablets which give them a sense of urgency and power, and the Egyptians with their papyrus paper given them a sense of elegance and innovation. These texts allow us to understand the importance of each page, and understand where they fell on within a social structure.
