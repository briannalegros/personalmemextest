> "Two facing pages are presented simultaneously in the codex, the back of one folio, or the verso, on the left side, and the front of the next folio, the recto, on the right. These two facing pages are not part of the same folio and may not necessarily have been part of the same sheet or the same quire; nevertheless, they have an important contiguous relationship."

Why do we format books this way. Some countries have the order going to opposite way, but the nevertheless this format is consistent. What's the link between the "recto" and the "verso" of these pages, and why are they placed in such a manner? It varies depending on the book topic, but typically the topic shifts between these pages, or sometimes is a continuation. They're linked together by the topic of the book, even if they fall under different titles. It's a way of classifying the data within a book by grouping similar related knowledge together.
